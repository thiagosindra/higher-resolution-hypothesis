## Overview

**The Higher-Resolution Hypothesis** proposes that autism arises not from isolated dysfunctions, but from a distinct *mode of neural organization*.
It introduces the **Distributed Pathway Model (DPM)** — a mechanistic framework describing how increased local branching and distributed propagation of neural activity can produce *higher representational density* throughout the brain.

This distributed topology enriches perception, memory, and associative thinking — creating what can be called *higher-resolution cognition* — but also imposes **dual constraints**: enhanced inhibition (creating selectivity and inflexibility) and energy competition (creating context-dependent failures and progressive degradation). When energy depletes, weakened inhibition enables **cascade susceptibility**, elevating risk for runaway activation and seizure-like events. The model provides a structural bridge between molecular genetics, circuit-level physiology, and lived autistic experience.

## Abstract

Autism may arise from distributed rather than streamlined neural architectures.
The **Higher-Resolution Hypothesis** views autism as the emergent cognitive expression of a **Distributed Pathway Model (DPM)** of connectivity — in which increased local branching, variable inhibition, and overlapping network activation yield higher representational precision and richer perceptual detail.

This architecture unifies several prior frameworks — *excitation/inhibition imbalance*, *predictive coding*, *intense world theory*, and *weak central coherence* — under a single topological explanation of autistic cognition.
It reframes autism as a *distributed computational mode* of the brain: capable of extraordinary sensitivity and depth, but also constrained by **dual limits** (enhanced inhibition creating selectivity, energy competition creating context-dependent failures) and susceptible to cascade activation when inhibition weakens under energetic load.
