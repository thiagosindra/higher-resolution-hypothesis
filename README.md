## Overview

**The Higher-Resolution Hypothesis** proposes that autism arises not from isolated dysfunctions, but from a distinct *mode of neural organization*.  
It introduces the **Distributed Pathway Model (DPM)** â€” a mechanistic framework describing how increased local branching and distributed propagation of neural activity can produce *higher representational density* throughout the brain.

This distributed topology enriches perception, memory, and associative thinking â€” creating what can be called *higher-resolution cognition* â€” but also increases energetic demand, instability, and vulnerability to overload.  
The model provides a structural bridge between molecular genetics, circuit-level physiology, and autistic phenomenology.

## Note on Research Status

This document is shared as an **open theoretical framework**, not a formal publication.  
It represents a working model intended to invite interdisciplinary discussion, critique, and potential empirical exploration.  
The ideas presented here are expected to evolve through dialogue with researchers in neuroscience, psychology, computational modeling, and related fields.  
All content remains Â© 2025 Thiago Sindra and may be updated as the framework develops.

## Abstract

Autism may arise from distributed rather than streamlined neural architectures.  
The **Higher-Resolution Hypothesis** views autism as the emergent cognitive expression of a **Distributed Pathway Model (DPM)** of connectivity â€” in which increased local branching, variable inhibition, and overlapping network activation yield higher representational precision and richer perceptual detail.

This architecture unifies several prior frameworks â€” *excitation/inhibition imbalance*, *predictive coding*, *intense world theory*, and *weak central coherence* â€” under a single topological explanation of autistic cognition.  
It reframes autism as a *distributed computational mode* of the brain: capable of extraordinary sensitivity and depth, but also susceptible to cascade activation and overload.
