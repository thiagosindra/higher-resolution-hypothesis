abstract: >
  The Higher-Resolution Hypothesis proposes that autism arises from a distributed neural
  architecture that produces higher-resolution cognition through overlapping network activation.
  It introduces the Distributed Pathway Model (DPM) as a mechanistic framework linking genetic,
  circuit-level, and cognitive evidence. The hypothesis reframes autism as an alternative
  computational mode of the brainâ€”capable of extraordinary sensitivity and precision, but also
  vulnerable to overload and instability.
