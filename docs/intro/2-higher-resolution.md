# Higher Resolution, Higher Cost

<p class="subtitle">How autistic brains achieve exceptional discrimination—and why it comes with trade-offs</p>

## The Core Question

What does it mean for a brain to process information at "higher resolution," and why would this create both strengths and challenges?

## The Camera Metaphor

Consider two cameras photographing the same scene:

<div class="comparison-grid">
  <div class="comparison-item">
    <h3>Standard Camera (8 megapixels)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>✓ Captures clear image, good enough for most purposes</li>
      <li>✓ Fast processing: Ready for next shot immediately</li>
      <li>✓ Works in normal lighting</li>
      <li>✓ Efficient: Minimal battery drain</li>
      <li>✓ File size: Manageable</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="comparison-item">
    <h3>Professional Camera (40 megapixels)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>★ Captures extraordinary detail invisible to standard camera</li>
      <li>⚠ Slower processing: Needs time between shots</li>
      <li>⚠ Demands excellent lighting</li>
      <li>⚠ Power-hungry: Drains battery quickly</li>
      <li>⚠ File size: Requires more storage</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</div>

Neither camera is 'better.' They're optimized for different purposes. The professional camera achieves higher resolution at the cost of higher resource demands.

**Autistic brains work on a similar principle—but the 'resolution' is neural, not visual.**

## What Neural Resolution Means

In the brain, 'resolution' means how many dimensions of information are captured and how finely differences are discriminated.

### Lower Resolution (Streamlined) Processing
- Captures essential features: 'This is a face'
- Fast categorization: Friend or stranger?
- Efficient: Uses minimal neurons
- Good enough for most social situations

### Higher Resolution (Distributed) Processing
- Captures extensive features: 'This face has subtle asymmetry in the eyebrows, a 3-degree leftward cant, microexpressions suggesting...'
- Precise discrimination: Detects subtle differences others miss
- Comprehensive: Uses many more neurons
- Enables exceptional pattern recognition

**This isn't about intelligence or capability—it's about different computational strategies.** One optimizes for speed and efficiency ('good enough, quickly'). The other optimizes for precision and completeness ('capture everything, accurately').

Neither is objectively better. A face-recognition system at an airport needs high resolution to distinguish similar faces. A friend greeting you in a crowded room needs only quick categorization. **Different tasks favor different resolutions.**

## Why Higher Resolution Creates Constraints

Here's the critical insight: **Higher resolution processing requires more resources.**

Just as the 40-megapixel camera needs:
- More light (or longer exposure)
- More processing time
- More battery power
- More storage space

Higher resolution neural processing requires:
- More neurons active simultaneously
- More processing time
- More metabolic energy (ATP)
- More memory capacity

<div class="callout">
<p><strong>The Trade-off:</strong> A camera has the option to switch resolutions—use high resolution when needed, standard when not. But neural architecture is relatively fixed. If your brain is built for high-resolution processing, it's always operating in that mode, even when efficiency would be more adaptive.</p>

## The Consequences

This means:

<div class="tradeoffs-grid">
  <div class="advantage">
    <span class="icon">✓</span>
    <p>You capture details others miss</p>
  </div>
  <div class="constraint">
    <span class="icon">✗</span>
    <p>You consume more energy doing it</p>
  </div>

  <div class="advantage">
    <span class="icon">✓</span>
    <p>Your representations are more precise</p>
  </div>
  <div class="constraint">
    <span class="icon">✗</span>
    <p>You struggle when demands exceed capacity</p>
  </div>

  <div class="advantage">
    <span class="icon">✓</span>
    <p>You can develop deep expertise</p>
  </div>
  <div class="constraint">
    <span class="icon">✗</span>
    <p>You have limited bandwidth for parallel processing</p>
  </div>
</div>

## What Comes Next

But how does a brain actually create higher resolution? What's different at the neural circuit level?

The answer lies in how autistic brains distribute information processing across neurons—using more of them, in overlapping patterns, creating a fundamentally different computational architecture.
