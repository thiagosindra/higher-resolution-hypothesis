# Distributed Pathways

<p class="subtitle">The neural architecture that creates higher resolution—and why it changes everything</p>

## The Core Question

What's actually different about autistic neural circuits, and how does this difference create higher resolution processing?

## The Fundamental Architectural Difference

Here's what makes autistic neural processing distinct:

<div class="architecture-comparison">
  <div class="arch-item">
    <h3>Neurotypical (Streamlined) Pathways</h3>
    <p><strong>Imagine a relay race.</strong> Information passes through a focused sequence:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Sensory input → Small specialized group → Quick decision → Output</li>
      <li>One clear path from input to output</li>
      <li>Minimal overlap between different processing streams</li>
      <li>Fast and efficient: Each neuron has a specific job</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="arch-item highlighted">
    <h3>Autistic (Distributed) Pathways</h3>
    <p><strong>Now imagine a crowd carrying information together:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Sensory input → Many overlapping groups → Comprehensive analysis → Output</li>
      <li>Multiple parallel paths processing the same information</li>
      <li>Extensive overlap: Groups share members</li>
      <li>Thorough but resource-intensive: 3-5× more neurons involved</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="callout primary">
  <p><strong>The Distributed Pathway Model:</strong> Autistic brains engage 3-5 times more neurons to process the same information, creating overlapping circuits that collectively provide higher-resolution representation.</p>
</div>

## Why More Neurons = Higher Resolution

Why does using more neurons create better discrimination? Think about how we increase resolution in other systems:

- **Image resolution:** More pixels capturing more spatial dimensions
- **Audio resolution:** More samples capturing more frequency dimensions
- **Neural resolution:** More neurons capturing more feature dimensions

### An Example: Processing Sound

When you engage more neurons to represent a sound:
- Neuron 1 responds to frequency
- Neuron 2 responds to timing
- Neuron 3 responds to amplitude changes
- Neuron 4 responds to harmonic structure
- Neurons 5-10 respond to combinations of these
- ...and so on

**Each neuron adds a dimension to the representation.** With 3-5× more neurons, you capture 3-5× more dimensions of the sound. This creates a high-dimensional representation space where subtle differences become distinguishable—differences that lower-dimensional representations collapse into "close enough."

This is why autistic individuals can:
- Detect pitch differences of fractions of a semitone
- Notice subtle visual patterns
- Remember conversations in exact detail

**They're operating in higher-dimensional representational spaces where these distinctions are preserved.**

## The Overlap Matters

Critically, these distributed pathways aren't just 'more neurons doing the same thing.' They **OVERLAP**—meaning multiple circuits share neurons and process related information simultaneously.

<div class="overlap-example">
  <p>Imagine three overlapping circles:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Circuit A</strong> (processing visual texture)</li>
    <li><strong>Circuit B</strong> (processing visual motion)</li>
    <li><strong>Circuit C</strong> (processing spatial layout)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>In streamlined processing, these circles barely touch. In distributed processing, they substantially overlap—the same neurons participate in multiple circuits.</p>
</div>

This overlap creates two crucial consequences:

1. **Enhanced integration:** Information from texture, motion, and space naturally combines because they share neural substrate

2. **Resource competition:** When circuits overlap, they compete for the same neurons, the same energy supplies, the same inhibitory control

## The Costs of Distributed Architecture

Using 3-5× more neurons in overlapping patterns creates higher resolution. But it also creates two fundamental constraints that shape everything about autistic cognition:

<div class="constraints-preview">
  <div class="constraint-box">
    <h3>Constraint 1: Enhanced Inhibition</h3>
    <p>When you activate more neurons, you need stronger inhibition to prevent runaway excitation and maintain signal-to-noise ratios. Those overlapping circuits recruit broader inhibitory networks.</p>
    <p><strong>This creates:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>✓ Better focus on selected information</li>
      <li>✗ Stronger suppression of competing information</li>
      <li>✗ Difficulty switching between processing modes</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="constraint-box">
    <h3>Constraint 2: Energy Competition</h3>
    <p>3-5× more neurons require 3-5× more energy (ATP). When circuits overlap in space, they're drawing from the same local energy supplies.</p>
    <p><strong>This creates:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>✓ Rich, detailed processing when energy is available</li>
      <li>✗ Rapid energy depletion in active regions</li>
      <li>✗ Other circuits can't activate—not enough energy left</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="callout warning">
  <p><strong>Critical Insight:</strong> These aren't separate problems. They're inherent consequences of the distributed architecture. You cannot have higher resolution without these trade-offs.</p>
</div>

## What Comes Next

Now we understand the architecture: distributed pathways using 3-5× more neurons in overlapping circuits. This creates higher resolution by capturing more dimensions.

But it also creates two unavoidable constraints: enhanced inhibition and energy competition. Understanding how these constraints work—and interact—is the key to understanding autism.
