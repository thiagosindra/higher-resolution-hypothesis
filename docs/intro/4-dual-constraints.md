# The Dual Constraints

<p class="subtitle">How inhibition and energy competition create the full autism phenotype</p>

## The Core Question

How do the consequences of distributed processing—enhanced inhibition and energy competition—work together to create both autistic strengths and challenges?

## Two Forces, One Architecture

Distributed pathways create higher resolution. But they also create two constraints that shape every aspect of autistic cognition:

1. **Enhanced Inhibition:** More active neurons recruit stronger suppression of competing circuits
2. **Energy Competition:** More neurons consume more metabolic resources, starving competing processes

These aren't flaws—they're inevitable consequences of the architecture. And they don't operate independently. They interact, creating dynamics that explain everything from sensory sensitivity to meltdowns to the need for predictability.

## Constraint 1: Enhanced Inhibition

### The Mechanism

When distributed pathways activate 3-5× more neurons, the brain faces a problem: How do you maintain signal clarity when more neurons are firing?

**The answer:** recruit proportionally stronger inhibition.

Think of it like volume control in a noisy room. If more people are talking (more neurons active), you need stronger 'shush' signals (inhibition) to hear any conversation clearly. Distributed pathways automatically engage broader inhibitory networks to maintain signal-to-noise ratios.

### What This Creates

<div class="effects-grid">
  <div class="effect positive">
    <strong>✓ Exceptional Focus</strong>
    <p>When you're engaged with something, you can focus with remarkable intensity. The strong inhibition blocks out distractions.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="effect negative">
    <strong>✗ Difficulty Switching</strong>
    <p>That same inhibition suppresses competing pathways—even when you WANT to switch attention. The new task's circuits are actively inhibited. You know you should switch, you try to switch, but the circuits won't respond.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="effect negative">
    <strong>✗ Reduced Flexibility</strong>
    <p>Once a processing mode is established, strong inhibition locks it in. Considering alternatives requires overcoming self-generated suppression of alternative circuits.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="effect positive">
    <strong>✓ Deep Over Broad</strong>
    <p>The architecture naturally supports depth in focused domains (maintained by strong inhibition) rather than breadth across many domains simultaneously.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="callout">
  <p>This explains the 'monotropic' attention style—not preference or stubbornness, but architectural consequence. Strong inhibition creates commitment to current processing mode.</p>
</div>

## Constraint 2: Energy Competition

### The Mechanism

Neural processing requires energy (ATP). Neurons share local energy supplies from nearby blood vessels. When distributed pathways engage 3-5× more neurons within a local brain region (like a cortical column), they consume 3-5× more energy from that shared pool.

Energy delivery can't instantly match demand spikes. When a distributed pathway exhausts local ATP reserves, other circuits in the same region face insufficient energy to activate—even if they're receiving strong input signals.

### What This Creates

<div class="effects-grid">
  <div class="effect positive">
    <strong>✓ Rich Processing When Available</strong>
    <p>When energy reserves are full, distributed pathways provide extraordinarily detailed, high-fidelity processing.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="effect negative">
    <strong>✗ Selective Processing Failures</strong>
    <p>Under sustained or multi-domain demands, some circuits literally cannot activate despite receiving input. You miss the auditory input not because you weren't paying attention, but because auditory circuits couldn't power up—visual circuits had consumed the available energy.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="effect negative">
    <strong>✗ Context-Dependent Performance</strong>
    <p>Same task, different outcomes depending on energy state. Early in the day (energy high): excellent performance. After sustained work (energy depleted): marked degradation.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="effect negative">
    <strong>✗ Progressive Degradation</strong>
    <p>As distributed processing continues, local energy depletes faster than delivery can restore it. Function degrades gradually: first flexibility, then accuracy, eventually collapse into overload.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="callout">
  <p>This explains the characteristic pattern of autistic performance: <strong>initial competence → gradual struggle → eventual overwhelm</strong>—all from the same task, just different energy states.</p>
</div>

## The Critical Interaction

Here's where it gets critical: **Inhibition itself requires energy.**

When energy depletes, two things happen simultaneously:
1. New circuits can't activate (insufficient energy)
2. Inhibition weakens (interneurons also starve)

This creates a regime transition:

<div class="phase-space">
  <h3>Four Processing States</h3>

  <div class="state-grid">
    <div class="state optimal">
      <h4>High Energy + Strong Inhibition</h4>
      <p class="state-label">(Autistic Optimal)</p>
      <ul>
        <li>✓ Distributed pathways active</li>
        <li>✓ Inhibition strong and selective</li>
        <li><strong>Result: Exceptional focused performance</strong></li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="state neurotypical">
      <h4>High Energy + Moderate Inhibition</h4>
      <p class="state-label">(Neurotypical)</p>
      <ul>
        <li>✓ Streamlined pathways efficient</li>
        <li>✓ Flexible switching available</li>
        <li><strong>Result: Good breadth, moderate depth</strong></li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="state struggling">
      <h4>Low Energy + Strong Inhibition</h4>
      <p class="state-label">(Effortful State)</p>
      <ul>
        <li>⚠ Pathways struggling</li>
        <li>⚠ Inhibition persists, creating inflexibility</li>
        <li><strong>Result: Stuck, rigid, effortful</strong></li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="state overload">
      <h4>Low Energy + Weak Inhibition</h4>
      <p class="state-label">(Overload/Collapse)</p>
      <ul>
        <li>✗ Pathways can't activate</li>
        <li>✗ Inhibition ineffective</li>
        <li><strong>Result: Neither good processing NOR good control—diffuse overwhelm</strong></li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="callout danger">
  <p><strong>The Progression to Meltdown/Shutdown:</strong> Autistic cognition under load moves from optimal → effortful → overload. This isn't emotional dysregulation—it's the neural system hitting capacity limits where both processing and control fail simultaneously.</p>
