# The Complete Picture

<p class="subtitle">How one architectural principle explains the full autism phenotype—and what this means</p>

## The Core Question

How does the Higher-Resolution Hypothesis with distributed pathways and dual constraints explain major autistic features, heterogeneity, and life outcomes?

## The Framework Summary

Let's bring it all together:

<div class="framework-summary">
  <div class="framework-box foundation">
    <h3>Foundation</h3>
    <p>Autistic brains use <strong>distributed pathways</strong>—3-5× more neurons processing information in overlapping circuits.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="framework-box primary-effect">
    <h3>Primary Effect</h3>
    <p><strong>Higher resolution</strong>—capturing more dimensions, enabling finer discrimination, supporting deep expertise.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="framework-box constraints">
    <h3>Dual Constraints</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Enhanced inhibition:</strong> Selectivity and inflexibility</li>
      <li><strong>Energy competition:</strong> Resource limits and context-dependent failures</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="framework-box result">
    <h3>Result</h3>
    <p>Exceptional abilities within focused domains, challenges with flexibility and sustained multi-domain processing, progression to overload under resource exhaustion.</p>
  </div>
</div>

## How This Explains Major Features

<div class="features-explained">

  <div class="feature-card">
    <h3>1. Sensory Sensitivity</h3>
    <p>Distributed pathways process sensory input with 3-5× more neurons, creating both enhanced discrimination AND greater total neural activity. Under energy depletion, inhibition weakens, creating sensory flooding. Same architecture creates hyper-sensitivity (engaged domain) and hypo-sensitivity (energy-starved competing domains).</p>
    <a href="../sections/sensory-cognition" class="learn-more">Learn more: Sensory Processing →</a>
  </div>

  <div class="feature-card">
    <h3>2. Executive Dysfunction</h3>
    <p>Task-switching requires releasing inhibition from current task AND providing energy for new task. Enhanced inhibition creates switching lag; energy competition prevents new task activation. Result: knowing you should switch but circuits being unresponsive.</p>
    <a href="../sections/executive-and-attention" class="learn-more">Learn more: Executive Function →</a>
  </div>

  <div class="feature-card">
    <h3>3. Special Interests</h3>
    <p>Distributed pathways in interest domains provide rich, rewarding processing. Strong inhibition maintains focus. If topics can be engaged with sustainable energy expenditure, they become preferred because they leverage architectural strengths.</p>
    <a href="../sections/predictive-coding-learning" class="learn-more">Learn more: Cognition & Learning →</a>
  </div>

  <div class="feature-card">
    <h3>4. Communication Differences</h3>
    <p>If distributed pathways concentrate in non-social domains, social processing receives fewer resources (breadth-over-depth trade-off). Social communication is also multi-domain (language + facial + gestural + prosody), making it energy-intensive when all must be processed simultaneously.</p>
    <a href="../sections/social-communication" class="learn-more">Learn more: Social Processing →</a>
  </div>

  <div class="feature-card">
    <h3>5. Motor Coordination</h3>
    <p>Motor planning engages distributed pathways competing energetically with sensory processing. Coordination degrades under cognitive load (energy competition) or when planning cannot complete before execution begins (insufficient switching time).</p>
    <a href="../sections/stimming-reactive-loops" class="learn-more">Learn more: Motor Systems →</a>
  </div>

  <div class="feature-card">
    <h3>6. Meltdowns/Shutdowns</h3>
    <p>Extended distributed processing depletes energy faster than restoration. Eventually both processing AND inhibitory control fail simultaneously—complete overwhelm. Requires hours of recovery for energy restoration and metabolic debt repayment.</p>
    <a href="../sections/energetic-collapse" class="learn-more">Learn more: Overload & Recovery →</a>
  </div>

  <div class="feature-card">
    <h3>7. Memory Differences</h3>
    <p>Distributed encoding captures more detail, creating vivid, detailed memories for attended information. But encoding is energy-expensive, creating selectivity: excellent memory for focused material, poor incidental memory for ignored information during energy competition.</p>
    <a href="../sections/memory-task-encoding" class="learn-more">Learn more: Memory & Learning →</a>
  </div>

  <div class="feature-card">
    <h3>8. Stimming & Self-Regulation</h3>
    <p>Repetitive movements provide rich, predictable proprioceptive input (engaging distributed processing beneficially) using energy-efficient motor programs. Stimming serves energy regulation, sensory satisfaction, and controlled engagement.</p>

## Why Is Autism So Variable?

The framework explains heterogeneity through individual variation:

<div class="heterogeneity-grid">
  <div class="variation-source">
    <h4>Pathway Distribution Varies</h4>
    <p>Some individuals have distributed pathways primarily in sensory domains, others in motor, others across multiple domains. Same principle, different implementations.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="variation-source">
    <h4>Metabolic Capacity Varies</h4>
    <p>Genetic differences in mitochondrial function create variation in energy availability—same architecture, different resource constraints.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="variation-source">
    <h4>Inhibitory Strength Varies</h4>
    <p>Genetic differences in inhibitory systems create variation in selectivity and flexibility.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="variation-source">
    <h4>Compensatory Strategies Vary</h4>
    <p>Learning, support, and opportunity create different developmental trajectories.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="callout">
  <p><strong>Result:</strong> Unified architecture + individual variation = spectrum diversity</p>
</div>

## Your Journey Recap

You now understand the Higher-Resolution Hypothesis:

1. **The Paradox:** Exceptional abilities and overwhelming challenges coexist
2. **Higher Resolution:** More neurons capture more dimensions = finer discrimination
3. **Distributed Pathways:** 3-5× more neurons in overlapping circuits create this resolution
4. **Dual Constraints:** Enhanced inhibition + energy competition shape the phenotype
5. **Complete Picture:** One architecture explains strengths, challenges, and heterogeneity
