# The Distributed Pathway Model (DPM)

The DPM describes how increased local branching and distributed propagation of neural activity
can enrich representation while reducing gating efficiency.  
This section explains the idea in approachable terms and links to the formal sections
in the [main document](higher-resolution-hypothesis.md#the-distributed-pathway-model-dpm).

Key ideas:
- Branching creates parallel micro-routes for the same signal.
- Overlap yields richer representation but greater energetic cost.
- Weak or delayed inhibition lets multiple pathways stay active simultaneously.

*In short, the DPM turns one input into many parallel interpretations â€” the foundation of higher-resolution cognition.*
