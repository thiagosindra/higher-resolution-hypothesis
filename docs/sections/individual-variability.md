    <p>I use <strong>active</strong> to mean pathways that are directly driven by an external or internal trigger (the "on-path" routes), and <strong>reactive</strong> to mean pathways that become engaged secondarily via distributed propagation (branch spillover). In DPM terms, heterogeneity in autism emerges from person-specific differences in:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>the branch density near key nodes (how many potential spillover routes exist),</li>
      <li>the gating characteristics of inhibition (how tightly or loosely spillover is contained), and</li>
      <li>the temporal profile of activity (how long reactive activity persists once engaged).</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Two people can share similar genetic variants yet express very different phenotypes if their active:reactive ratio and reactive topology differ. A high active:reactive ratio (tighter gating, fewer sustained spillovers) yields strong detail processing with relatively stable behavior. A lower ratio (looser gating, broader sustained spillovers) yields the same high resolution but with more overlap, reverberation, and volatility. This simple mapping explains why siblings with similar genetic risk can present differently: the pattern and persistence of reactive spread—not just the presence of branching—shapes the day-to-day experience and support needs.</p>

    <p>I also expect domain-specific ratios: e.g., high reactive spread in sensory networks but lower spread in language circuits, or vice-versa. This predicts the observed "spiky" profiles (islands of strength and difficulty) common in autism.</p>

    <p>Autism is extraordinarily heterogeneous: individuals vary widely in sensory sensitivity, verbal ability, cognitive style, and support needs. The Distributed Pathway Model accounts for this variability through differences in the ratio and topology of <strong>active versus reactive pathways</strong>. Active pathways are directly engaged by a stimulus or intention; reactive pathways are recruited secondarily through distributed propagation—spillover activity that crosses from one branch to another.</p>

    <p>Individual differences in autism emerge from three key parameters: (1) <strong>branch density</strong> near critical circuit nodes, determining how many reactive routes are available; (2) <strong>inhibitory gating strength</strong>, controlling how tightly spillover is contained; and (3) <strong>temporal persistence</strong>, governing how long reactive activity continues once triggered. Together, these parameters define each person's active:reactive ratio.</p>

    <p>A high active:reactive ratio—tighter gating and fewer sustained spillovers—produces high-resolution processing with relatively stable regulation. Detail perception remains sharp, but cascade susceptibility is lower. A low ratio—looser gating and broader spillovers—produces the same resolution but with greater overlap, reverberation, and volatility. This accounts for the spectrum of autistic presentation: genetic risk may be similar, but the circuit-level expression differs based on how reactive spread is contained and routed.</p>

    <p>Importantly, these ratios can vary <strong>across domains</strong>. One individual might have high reactive spread in sensory cortices (leading to sensory overload) but tighter gating in language regions (producing relatively typical verbal fluency). Another might show the reverse. This domain-specific variation predicts the characteristic "spiky" profile of autism—islands of exceptional ability alongside areas of significant challenge. Rather than a uniform global difference, autism reflects a mosaic of localized branching and gating patterns, each producing its own balance of resolution and stability.</p>

    <p>Understanding variability through active:reactive mappings shifts the clinical focus from categorical diagnoses to individualized circuit profiles. It also explains why siblings with similar genetic variants can differ markedly in phenotype: the genes influence branching and inhibition, but the specific topology—where branches form, how they connect, and how long they persist—determines the lived experience.</p>

    <p>One of the most striking features of autism is its variability. Two autistic individuals can have very different profiles: one might be highly verbal and socially engaged but overwhelmed by sensory input, while another might be minimally verbal with strong visual-spatial skills and less sensory sensitivity. The Distributed Pathway Model explains this diversity through differences in how neural branching and inhibitory control are distributed across the brain.</p>

    <p>Think of neural pathways as being either <strong>active</strong> (directly responding to a stimulus or intention) or <strong>reactive</strong> (recruited secondarily when activity spills over from nearby branches). Everyone has both types, but the ratio between them varies. When inhibitory control is strong and spillover is limited, you get high-resolution processing with relatively stable regulation—detail-oriented cognition without as much cascade activation. When inhibitory gating is weaker and spillover is more extensive, you still get high resolution, but also more overlap, reverberation, and volatility.</p>

    <p>Crucially, this ratio doesn't have to be uniform across the brain. You might have extensive reactive spread in sensory regions—leading to sensory overload—but tighter control in language areas, producing fluent verbal ability. Or the reverse: strong language branching with well-regulated sensory processing. This domain-specific variation explains the "spiky" profiles common in autism: exceptional abilities in some areas alongside significant challenges in others.</p>

    <p>This framework helps explain why two people with similar genetic risk factors can present so differently. The genes influence the general tendency toward branching and altered inhibition, but the specific pattern—where branches form, how they connect, and how long activity persists—varies from person to person. Understanding autism through these individualized circuit patterns, rather than as a single categorical diagnosis, allows for more targeted support that addresses each person's specific balance of strengths and challenges.</p>
