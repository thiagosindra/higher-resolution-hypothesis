    <p>In predictive coding models, the brain minimizes surprise by comparing forward predictions against incoming data. Distributed branching complicates this process: because too many microfeatures remain active across parallel pathways, top-down compression becomes difficult. The autistic brain favors strong local reinforcement over hierarchical abstraction, yielding precise but less generalized learning. In practical terms, distributed networks assign higher precision-weighting to sensory input relative to priors—more microcircuits encode raw data, fewer remain for abstract filtering. This produces exceptional accuracy in detail-oriented tasks but difficulty generalizing across ambiguous contexts.</p>

    <p>Repeated activation of the same distributed pathway disproportionately strengthens it, explaining intense, focused interests: these become "islands of coherence" where prediction error is minimal. Dopaminergic reinforcement stabilizes these loops, making mastery intrinsically rewarding. Conversely, unpredictability amplifies discomfort: a single prediction error propagates through multiple branches, subjectively magnifying its impact. Preference for sameness and routine reflects a rational adaptation to reduce entropy in a distributed system.</p>

    <p>Crucially, when unresolved predictive conflicts accumulate across distributed pathways, the result is <strong>predictive overload</strong>—too many competing expectations remain active simultaneously. Informational uncertainty grows exponentially, forcing the system to consume increasing energy to maintain coherence. This escalation links predictive instability directly to the metabolic exhaustion underlying <strong>energetic collapse</strong>, illustrating how informational overload transitions into physiological depletion.</p>

  <div id="tab-gen" class="tab-panel">
    <p>Your brain constantly predicts what's coming next, then checks those predictions against reality. In a distributed system, predictions don't come from one central "control tower"—they emerge from many semi-independent circuits, each making its own guess. This creates both strengths and vulnerabilities. When you dive deep into a favorite topic, repeated practice strengthens those specific pathways into stable, low-error zones where everything makes sense. That mastery feels rewarding because your brain finally has a domain where predictions reliably match outcomes.</p>

    <p>But when facing uncertainty, the distributed architecture turns prediction errors into amplified confusion. One surprise doesn't just update one model—it ripples through multiple parallel guesses, each demanding resolution. If conflicts pile up faster than they can be reconciled, you enter <strong>predictive overload</strong>: your brain is running too many incompatible models at once, each burning energy to stay active. This informational chaos directly drives metabolic exhaustion—the system can't sustain the energetic cost of maintaining conflicting predictions indefinitely. What begins as informational uncertainty ends as physical fatigue and collapse.</p>
