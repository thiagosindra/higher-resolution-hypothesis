    <p>In predictive coding models, the brain minimizes surprise by comparing forward predictions against incoming data. Distributed branching complicates this process: because too many microfeatures remain active across parallel pathways, top-down compression becomes difficult. The autistic brain favors strong local reinforcement over hierarchical abstraction, yielding precise but less generalized learning. In practical terms, distributed networks assign higher precision-weighting to sensory input relative to priors—more microcircuits encode raw data, fewer remain for abstract filtering. This produces exceptional accuracy in detail-oriented tasks but difficulty generalizing across ambiguous contexts.</p>

    <p>Repeated activation of the same distributed pathway disproportionately strengthens it, explaining intense, focused interests: these become "islands of coherence" where prediction error is minimal. Dopaminergic reinforcement stabilizes these loops, making mastery intrinsically rewarding. Conversely, unpredictability amplifies discomfort: a single prediction error propagates through multiple branches, subjectively magnifying its impact. Preference for sameness and routine reflects a rational adaptation to reduce entropy in a distributed system.</p>

    <p>Crucially, when unresolved predictive conflicts accumulate across distributed pathways, the result is <strong>predictive overload</strong>—too many competing expectations remain active simultaneously. Informational uncertainty grows exponentially, forcing the system to consume increasing energy to maintain coherence. This directly contributes to the energetic collapse described in shutdown and meltdown states, as metabolic demand outstrips supply. The cascade from executive strain (coordination failure) through predictive overload (informational instability) to energetic collapse (metabolic exhaustion) reflects the multi-level vulnerability of distributed neural architectures.</p>

  <div id="tab-gen" class="tab-panel">
    <p>The brain continuously generates predictions about incoming information, comparing expected patterns against actual sensory input. In distributed neural architecture, these predictions become highly detailed because numerous circuits contribute fine-grained expectations based on their local processing. This produces exceptional accuracy in pattern recognition when environmental regularities are consistent—autistic individuals often detect subtle patterns and develop deep expertise in focused domains more readily than neurotypical individuals.</p>

    <p>However, this same precision makes prediction errors more disruptive. When reality deviates from expectation, the discrepancy propagates through multiple prediction pathways simultaneously, amplifying the subjective experience of unexpectedness and the computational cost of updating internal models. This explains the strong preference for predictability and routine in autism: consistent patterns minimize prediction errors across many concurrent pathways, reducing both cognitive load and the distress associated with widespread model mismatch.</p>

    <p>Special interests serve a regulatory function within this framework. When an individual develops deep expertise in a domain, their internal models for that domain become highly accurate and stable. Engaging with the special interest produces consistently correct predictions, creating a state of low entropy and minimal prediction error. This process is reinforced through dopaminergic reward systems—accurate prediction itself becomes intrinsically satisfying. Special interests thus function as cognitive refuges where the distributed system operates efficiently, experiencing mastery and coherence rather than uncertainty and interference.</p>

    <p>Conversely, when multiple predictions conflict simultaneously—during unpredictable situations, ambiguous contexts, or rapid environmental changes—the system accumulates unresolved predictive conflicts. Each conflict continues consuming metabolic resources as circuits attempt concurrent resolution. This informational overload directly contributes to energetic collapse: the brain's attempt to maintain and update too many conflicting predictions scales energy demand beyond sustainable levels, ultimately forcing shutdown or meltdown. The preference for structure and deep focus reflects adaptive strategies for managing prediction load in a high-resolution cognitive architecture.</p>
