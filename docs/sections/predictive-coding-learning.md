    <p>In predictive coding models, the brain minimizes surprise by comparing forward predictions against incoming data. Distributed branching complicates this process: because too many microfeatures remain active across parallel pathways, top-down compression becomes difficult. The autistic brain favors strong local reinforcement over hierarchical abstraction, yielding precise but less generalized learning. In practical terms, distributed networks assign higher precision-weighting to sensory input relative to priors—more microcircuits encode raw data, fewer remain for abstract filtering. This produces exceptional accuracy in detail-oriented tasks but difficulty generalizing across ambiguous contexts.</p>

    <p>Repeated activation of the same distributed pathway disproportionately strengthens it, explaining intense, focused interests: these become "islands of coherence" where prediction error is minimal. Dopaminergic reinforcement stabilizes these loops, making mastery intrinsically rewarding. Conversely, unpredictability amplifies discomfort: a single prediction error propagates through multiple branches, subjectively magnifying its impact. Preference for sameness and routine reflects a rational adaptation to reduce entropy in a distributed system.</p>

    <p>Crucially, when unresolved predictive conflicts accumulate across distributed pathways, the result is <strong>predictive overload</strong>—too many competing expectations remain active simultaneously. Informational uncertainty grows exponentially, forcing the system to consume increasing energy to maintain coherence. This directly contributes to the energetic collapse described in shutdown and meltdown states, as metabolic demand outstrips supply. The cascade from executive strain (coordination failure) through predictive overload (informational instability) to energetic collapse (metabolic exhaustion) reflects the multi-level vulnerability of distributed neural architectures.</p>

    <p>Your brain constantly guesses what will happen next—it's how you catch a ball or finish someone's sentence. In a distributed system, those guesses get very detailed because so many circuits are generating predictions based on fine-grained input. This makes you exceptionally accurate when patterns are consistent: you notice tiny regularities others miss, and quickly become expert in areas you focus on. But it also makes surprises feel bigger—a single unexpected event ripples through many prediction pathways, amplifying the sense of "wrongness." That's why routines and predictability feel so important: they keep prediction errors low across all those active branches. When you dive deep into a special interest, you're creating a zone where your brain's predictions are almost always right—it's intrinsically rewarding because everything clicks into place. The flip side: when too many predictions conflict at once (during chaos or ambiguity), your brain burns energy trying to resolve them all. Eventually, the system runs out of fuel and either shuts down or melts down. It's not about being rigid—it's about managing the information load in a high-resolution system.</p>
