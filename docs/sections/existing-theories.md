    <h2>DPM as Unifying Structural Framework</h2>

    <p>Autism research has generated numerous theoretical frameworks, each capturing distinct aspects of autistic cognition and neurobiology. Rather than competing with these established theories, the Distributed Pathway Model provides a structural substrate that explains how they mechanistically relate to one another. Each theory describes a different projection or level of analysis of the same underlying neural architecture. DPM synthesizes these perspectives by anchoring them in measurable circuit topology—branching density, inhibitory gating strength, and oscillatory dynamics—from which the diverse phenomenological and computational features emerge as natural consequences.</p>

    <h3>Excitation/Inhibition (E/I) Imbalance</h3>

    <p>E/I imbalance theories propose that autism involves altered ratios of excitatory to inhibitory neurotransmission, typically favoring excitation through reduced GABAergic signaling, delayed inhibitory circuit maturation, or increased glutamatergic drive. Within DPM, E/I balance functions as the primary control parameter governing distributed propagation. Reduced or delayed inhibition lowers the threshold for spillover from active pathways into reactive branches, increases the temporal persistence of activation before suppression, and allows concurrent engagement of partially overlapping circuits.</p>

    <p>DPM treats E/I imbalance not as a separate pathology but as the gating dynamic that enables distributed architecture to express itself. Inhibitory interneurons—particularly parvalbumin-positive (PV+) fast-spiking cells and somatostatin-positive (SST+) feedback regulators—normally constrain propagation both spatially (limiting spread across collaterals) and temporally (terminating activation rapidly). When this inhibitory constraint weakens, the preserved collateral branches become functionally active routes rather than silent anatomical potentials. Thus E/I imbalance determines the active:reactive ratio: stronger inhibition increases active processing relative to reactive spillover, while weaker inhibition allows reactive pathways to dominate.</p>

    <p>Empirical support for E/I imbalance includes reduced GABA concentration measured via MRS, altered GAD67 and parvalbumin expression in post-mortem tissue, reduced gamma oscillation power (generated by PV+ circuits), and genetic variants affecting GABAergic signaling (e.g., GABRB3, GAD1). DPM integrates these findings by positioning E/I balance as the mechanistic regulator of distributed topology's functional expression.</p>

    <h3>Intense World Theory</h3>

    <p>Intense World Theory, developed from valproate rodent models, emphasizes hyper-reactivity, hyper-plasticity, and hyper-memory formation in autism. The theory proposes that autistic individuals experience the world with heightened intensity—sensory inputs produce stronger neural responses, memories are formed more readily and persist longer, and emotional reactions are amplified. DPM provides the circuit-level topology underlying this intensity.</p>

    <p>Dense local branching and distributed propagation naturally amplify input: the same sensory stimulus recruits 3-5× more neurons through collateral pathways compared to streamlined hierarchical processing. This yields higher representational density—more neurons encoding finer distinctions—which manifests phenomenologically as intensity. Hyper-plasticity follows from sustained activation across distributed ensembles: when multiple partially overlapping populations encode the same event, synaptic strengthening occurs simultaneously across these pathways, producing redundant encoding that resists forgetting. Hyper-reactivity reflects weak inhibitory gating allowing excitatory spread to dominate.</p>

    <p>Intense World Theory describes the phenomenology—what autism feels like from the inside—while DPM describes the wiring diagram that generates that phenomenology. The two frameworks are complementary: intensity is the subjective correlate of distributed, high-resolution encoding.</p>

    <h3>Predictive Coding and HIPPEA (High, Inflexible Precision of Prediction Errors in Autism)</h3>

    <p>Predictive coding frameworks model perception and cognition as hierarchical Bayesian inference: top-down predictions are compared to bottom-up sensory signals, and prediction errors drive learning and updating. HIPPEA proposes that autism involves abnormally high precision-weighting of prediction errors—discrepancies between predictions and sensory data are treated as highly informative and difficult to downregulate, while priors (learned expectations) have reduced influence.</p>

    <p>DPM explains this precision imbalance structurally. Increased local branching dedicates more neurons to encoding incoming sensory data, effectively raising the representational weight of bottom-up signals. In hierarchical predictive coding, precision is mathematically equivalent to inverse variance—how much a signal should be trusted. More neurons encoding sensory features translate to higher precision estimates for sensory input. Simultaneously, reduced long-range connectivity and weak hierarchical inhibition limit the influence of top-down priors generated in higher cortical areas.</p>

    <p>When prediction errors occur, they propagate through distributed pathways rather than being efficiently suppressed by top-down predictions. This broad propagation increases the computational and subjective cost of uncertainty, explaining why unpredictability is particularly aversive in autism. Preference for routine, resistance to change, and enhanced pattern recognition all follow from a system that assigns high precision to sensory input and struggles to compress it via learned models. HIPPEA captures the computational consequence; DPM provides the topology that produces it.</p>

    <h3>Weak Central Coherence (WCC) and Enhanced Perceptual Functioning (EPF)</h3>

    <p>Weak Central Coherence theory proposes that autistic cognition favors local detail processing over global integration—difficulty seeing "the forest for the trees." Enhanced Perceptual Functioning complements this by emphasizing superior performance on tasks requiring local feature discrimination. These appear to describe opposite poles (deficit vs. strength), but DPM unifies them as two manifestations of the same architectural principle.</p>

    <p>Locally dense branching creates rich, detailed representations within circumscribed cortical modules, supporting exceptional perceptual discrimination (EPF). However, reduced long-range connectivity, fragmented oscillatory synchrony, and weak hierarchical gating impair the integration of these local representations into coherent global percepts (WCC). The same topology that enhances local resolution limits global binding.</p>

    <p>Neurophysiologically, this corresponds to local hyperconnectivity (short-range) coexisting with long-range hypoconnectivity, a pattern consistently observed in fMRI and DTI studies of autism. Local gamma oscillations may be intact or enhanced in circumscribed regions, supporting local binding, while cross-region phase coherence is reduced, impairing global integration. WCC and EPF are not competing theories but complementary descriptions of distributed architecture's strengths and limitations.</p>

    <h3>Kozima's Granularity Theory</h3>

    <p>Granularity Theory proposes that autistic perception and cognition operate at finer granularity—smaller units of analysis, more micro-features concurrently represented, higher dimensional feature spaces. This maps directly onto DPM's concept of representational density. Increased branching allows more neurons to sample the same stimulus, effectively raising the sampling resolution—more dimensions, finer distinctions, higher granularity.</p>

    <p>In signal processing terms, DPM increases the Nyquist frequency of neural sampling: more frequent sampling points capture higher-frequency features that coarser sampling would miss. This enables detection of subtle patterns, fine sensory discriminations, and detailed memory encoding, but also increases data volume, processing time, and energetic cost. Granularity Theory provides the information-theoretic perspective; DPM provides the circuit implementation.</p>

    <h3>Minicolumn Hypotheses and Synaptic Pruning Accounts</h3>

    <p>Post-mortem histological studies have identified structural alterations in autistic cortex: narrower minicolumns with reduced spacing, altered inhibitory surrounds, reduced dendritic branching complexity in some regions, and elevated synaptic spine density indicating reduced pruning. These anatomical findings provide histological grounding for DPM's topological predictions.</p>

    <p>Narrower minicolumns with reduced inhibitory surrounds decrease lateral inhibition between adjacent processing units, facilitating crosstalk and distributed propagation. Elevated spine density directly reflects reduced synaptic pruning, preserving collateral branches that would normally be eliminated. Altered GABAergic interneuron distribution (particularly PV+ basket cells surrounding minicolumns) maps onto DPM's prediction of weakened inhibitory gating.</p>

    <p>These structural findings anchor DPM in measurable cortical cytoarchitecture, linking molecular and genetic alterations (pruning regulators, interneuron migration factors) to circuit topology (branching, inhibition) to phenomenology (high resolution, overload, intensity).</p>

    <h3>Synthesis: DPM as Structural Bridge</h3>

    <p>DPM does not compete with these established theories—it organizes them into a coherent multi-level framework. Genetic and molecular findings (CHD8, SHANK3, PTEN, FMR1) affect pruning, branching, and inhibitory development. These produce circuit-level topology (distributed pathways, weak gating). This topology generates computational properties (precision-weighting, granularity, local hyperconnectivity). These computational properties manifest as phenomenology (intensity, sensory acuity, detail focus, overload).</p>

    <p>Each existing theory captures one level or projection of this cascade. E/I imbalance describes the gating mechanism. Intense World describes the phenomenology. Predictive coding describes the computational consequence. WCC/EPF describe the integration trade-offs. Minicolumn accounts provide histological evidence. DPM provides the structural bridge that shows how these levels mechanistically connect, transforming a collection of separate observations into a unified architecture.</p>

    <h2>How DPM Connects Existing Autism Theories</h2>

    <p>The Distributed Pathway Model is not intended to replace existing autism theories but to provide a unifying structural framework that explains how diverse theoretical accounts relate to one another. Each established theory captures a different level or aspect of autistic cognition; DPM offers the circuit-level topology that connects them into a coherent whole.</p>

    <h3>Excitation/Inhibition (E/I) Imbalance: The Gating Mechanism</h3>

    <p><strong>E/I Imbalance theory</strong> proposes that autism involves altered balance between excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission, typically favoring excitation through reduced GABAergic signaling or increased glutamatergic drive. This theory explains why neural signals spread more broadly and persist longer in autism.</p>

    <p>Within DPM, E/I balance functions as the control parameter governing distributed propagation. Inhibitory neurons—the brain's brakes—normally constrain how far signals spread (spatially) and how long they last (temporally). When inhibition is reduced or delayed, the preserved collateral branches identified by DPM become functionally active pathways rather than dormant anatomical structures. E/I imbalance thus determines the active:reactive ratio: stronger inhibition favors goal-directed processing with limited spillover, while weaker inhibition allows reactive pathways to dominate.</p>

    <p>E/I imbalance is not a separate dysfunction from distributed architecture—it's the gating dynamic that allows distributed topology to express itself functionally. The branches exist anatomically due to reduced pruning; E/I balance determines whether signals actually propagate through them.</p>

    <h3>Intense World Theory: The Phenomenology of Distributed Processing</h3>

    <p><strong>Intense World Theory</strong> emphasizes that autistic individuals experience heightened intensity—stronger sensory responses, deeper emotional reactions, more persistent memories. This theory emerged from animal models showing hyper-reactivity and hyper-plasticity.</p>

    <p>DPM provides the structural explanation for this intensity. Dense local branching means the same sensory input recruits more neurons through distributed pathways—perhaps 3-5 times more than in typical processing. This creates higher representational density: more neurons encoding finer distinctions, which manifests experientially as intensity. Hyper-plasticity follows naturally: when multiple partially overlapping neural populations encode the same event, synaptic strengthening occurs across all these pathways simultaneously, creating redundant, persistent memories.</p>

    <p>Intense World describes what autism feels like; DPM describes the neural wiring that produces that feeling. The two frameworks are complementary perspectives on the same underlying reality.</p>

    <h3>Predictive Coding and HIPPEA: Computational Consequences</h3>

    <p><strong>Predictive coding theories</strong> model cognition as Bayesian inference: the brain generates predictions about incoming information and updates these predictions when they don't match reality. <strong>HIPPEA (High, Inflexible Precision of Prediction Errors in Autism)</strong> proposes that autistic cognition weighs sensory input more heavily than learned expectations, making prediction errors particularly salient and difficult to downregulate.</p>

    <p>DPM explains this precision imbalance structurally. More local branches dedicate more neurons to representing bottom-up sensory signals, effectively increasing the weight of "what's actually happening" relative to "what we expect to happen." In predictive coding terms, this means higher precision-weighting for sensory data and lower influence for top-down priors.</p>

    <p>When prediction errors occur—when reality doesn't match expectations—they propagate through distributed pathways rather than being efficiently suppressed by top-down predictions. This amplifies both the computational cost (more pathways to update) and the subjective cost (more salient mismatch signal). This explains preference for routine (minimizing prediction errors), resistance to change (high cost of updating), and exceptional pattern detection (high-resolution encoding of actual data).</p>

    <p>HIPPEA describes the computational consequence; DPM provides the topology that produces it.</p>

    <h3>Weak Central Coherence and Enhanced Perceptual Functioning: Two Sides of the Same Architecture</h3>

    <p><strong>Weak Central Coherence (WCC)</strong> proposes that autistic cognition favors processing local details over global integration—"missing the forest for the trees." <strong>Enhanced Perceptual Functioning (EPF)</strong> emphasizes superior performance on tasks requiring fine perceptual discrimination. These theories appear to describe opposites—deficit versus strength—but DPM shows they're two faces of the same architectural coin.</p>

    <p>Locally dense branching creates rich, detailed representations within local brain regions, supporting exceptional discrimination of fine features (EPF). However, reduced long-range connectivity and fragmented oscillatory synchrony make it difficult to integrate these detailed local representations into coherent global percepts (WCC). The same topology that enhances local resolution impairs global binding.</p>

    <p>Brain imaging supports this: fMRI and DTI studies consistently show local hyperconnectivity (short-range) coexisting with long-range hypoconnectivity in autism. Local neural populations may synchronize well within themselves, enabling detailed local processing, but synchronization across distant regions is fragmented, limiting global integration.</p>

    <p>WCC and EPF aren't competing theories—they're complementary descriptions of distributed architecture's computational trade-offs.</p>

    <h3>Granularity Theory: Information-Theoretic Perspective</h3>

    <p><strong>Granularity Theory</strong> proposes that autistic perception and cognition operate at finer granularity—processing smaller units of information, representing more micro-features simultaneously, operating in higher-dimensional feature spaces.</p>

    <p>This maps directly onto DPM's representational density. More neural branches sampling the same stimulus means higher sampling resolution—like increasing pixel count in a digital image. This enables detection of finer distinctions and subtle patterns but also increases processing time, memory load, and energetic cost.</p>

    <p>Granularity Theory provides the information-theoretic description; DPM provides the circuit implementation that produces that granularity.</p>

    <h3>Minicolumn and Pruning Hypotheses: Anatomical Evidence</h3>

    <p><strong>Minicolumn hypotheses</strong> describe structural brain differences observed in post-mortem autism studies: narrower cortical minicolumns, altered inhibitory surrounds, and elevated synaptic spine density indicating reduced pruning. These anatomical findings provide physical evidence for DPM's topological predictions.</p>

    <p>Narrower minicolumns with reduced inhibitory surrounds facilitate crosstalk between adjacent processing modules, promoting distributed propagation. Elevated spine density directly reflects reduced synaptic pruning—the collateral branches that DPM proposes are being preserved rather than eliminated during development. Altered distribution of inhibitory interneurons aligns with DPM's prediction of weakened inhibitory gating.</p>

    <p>These structural findings anchor DPM in measurable brain anatomy, linking molecular causes (genes affecting pruning and inhibition) to circuit topology (branching patterns) to cognitive outcomes (high resolution, intensity, overload).</p>

    <h3>DPM as Organizing Framework</h3>

    <p>DPM functions as a structural bridge connecting different levels of analysis:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Molecular level:</strong> Genes affecting pruning, synapse formation, inhibitory development</li>
      <li><strong>Circuit level:</strong> Distributed branching, weak inhibitory gating, altered oscillations</li>
      <li><strong>Computational level:</strong> Precision-weighting, granularity, local-global trade-offs</li>
      <li><strong>Phenomenological level:</strong> Intensity, sensory acuity, detail focus, overload, predictability preference</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Each existing theory captures one level or aspect of this cascade. E/I imbalance describes the gating mechanism. Intense World describes the phenomenology. Predictive coding describes computational consequences. WCC/EPF describe integration trade-offs. Minicolumn accounts provide anatomical evidence.</p>

    <p>DPM doesn't compete with these theories—it organizes them into a coherent multi-level framework, showing how molecular differences produce circuit changes that generate computational properties that manifest as lived experience. This integration transforms separate observations into a unified understanding of autistic neurocognitive architecture.</p>

    <h2>How Different Autism Theories Fit Together</h2>

    <p>Over the years, researchers have developed many different theories to explain autism. You might have heard of some of them: Intense World Theory, Excitation/Inhibition Imbalance, Predictive Coding, Weak Central Coherence. These theories can seem contradictory or confusing—like different people describing different conditions.</p>

    <p>The Distributed Pathway Model doesn't replace these theories. Instead, it shows how they all fit together—like puzzle pieces that were always part of the same picture. Each theory is describing a different aspect of the same underlying brain architecture.</p>

    <h3>E/I Imbalance: The Volume Control</h3>

    <p><strong>What the theory says:</strong> Excitation/Inhibition (E/I) Imbalance theory proposes that autistic brains have an imbalance between signals that activate neurons (excitation) and signals that quiet them down (inhibition). Typically, there's too much excitation or too little inhibition, like a car with a weak brake system.</p>

    <p><strong>How DPM connects it:</strong> Remember how DPM describes the brain's "brake system"—inhibitory neurons that stop signals from spreading too far? E/I imbalance is the theory that explains <em>why</em> those brakes are weaker in autism.</p>

    <p>Think of it this way:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>DPM says:</strong> "Your brain has many extra pathways preserved from development" (the road network has more roads)</li>
      <li><strong>E/I Imbalance says:</strong> "Your traffic lights and stop signs don't work as well" (the control system is weaker)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Together, they explain the full picture: You have more pathways <em>and</em> weaker control over them. E/I balance acts like a volume knob that controls how much distributed processing happens—weak inhibition turns the volume up, strong inhibition turns it down.</p>

    <h3>Intense World Theory: How It Feels</h3>

    <p><strong>What the theory says:</strong> Intense World Theory proposes that autistic people experience everything more intensely—sensory input feels stronger, memories are more vivid and persistent, emotional reactions are more powerful. It's not that you're being "oversensitive"—the world genuinely registers more intensely in your brain.</p>

    <p><strong>How DPM connects it:</strong> DPM explains <em>why</em> everything feels more intense. When distributed pathways activate 3-5 times more neurons for the same input, the resulting experience is naturally more vivid, detailed, and persistent.</p>

    <p>Imagine two people watching the same sunset:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Neurotypical brain (compressed processing):</strong> Registers "sunset, orange, pretty" with moderate emotional response</li>
      <li><strong>Autistic brain (distributed processing):</strong> Simultaneously registers the precise gradient of colors, the way light refracts through clouds, the temperature shift, the sound of evening birds, the emotional associations with previous sunsets, the texture of the air—all at once, all intensely</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Intense World Theory describes <em>what it feels like</em>. DPM describes <em>the neural wiring that makes it feel that way</em>. They're describing the same reality from different angles—phenomenology versus mechanism.</p>

    <h3>Predictive Coding: Why Surprises Hit Harder</h3>

    <p><strong>What the theory says:</strong> Predictive coding theories propose that your brain constantly predicts what will happen next, then compares predictions to reality. In autism, the theory suggests that sensory reality (what's actually happening) is weighted much more heavily than predictions (what you expect to happen). This makes unexpected changes particularly jarring.</p>

    <p><strong>How DPM connects it:</strong> DPM explains <em>why</em> your brain weights sensory input so heavily. More local branches mean more neurons dedicated to encoding what's actually there, making "reality" louder than "expectations" in the brain's processing.</p>

    <p>Think of it like weather forecasting:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Neurotypical brain:</strong> Uses historical averages heavily (it's usually sunny in July, so probably sunny today) and trusts predictions even when current data differs slightly</li>
      <li><strong>Autistic brain:</strong> Weights current sensor data heavily (the barometer is falling, humidity is rising, clouds are forming) and treats any mismatch with predictions as highly significant</li>
    </ul>

    <p>When predictions turn out wrong, distributed pathways mean the "error signal" propagates through many circuits, making the mismatch feel very significant. This explains:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Why unexpected changes are so distressing (large error signal spreading widely)</li>
      <li>Why routines are comforting (minimizing prediction errors)</li>
      <li>Why you notice patterns others miss (high-resolution encoding of actual data)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Predictive coding describes the computational consequence. DPM describes the architecture that produces it.</p>

    <h3>Weak Central Coherence vs. Enhanced Perceptual Functioning: Two Sides of One Coin</h3>

    <p><strong>What the theories say:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Weak Central Coherence (WCC):</strong> Autistic people tend to focus on details rather than the big picture—difficulty "seeing the forest for the trees"</li>
      <li><strong>Enhanced Perceptual Functioning (EPF):</strong> Autistic people excel at noticing fine details and discriminating subtle differences</li>
    </ul>

    <p>These sound like opposites—one a "deficit," one a "strength"—but they're actually describing the same thing from different perspectives.</p>

    <p><strong>How DPM connects them:</strong> Imagine looking at a painting:</p>

    <p><strong>Neurotypical brain (compressed processing):</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Quickly captures overall composition (good global integration)</li>
      <li>Sees "a portrait of a woman" (central coherence)</li>
      <li>May miss individual brushstrokes (lower local resolution)</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Autistic brain (distributed processing):</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Notices every brushstroke, color variation, texture detail (enhanced local processing = EPF)</li>
      <li>May take longer to integrate these details into "overall portrait of a woman" (weak global integration = WCC)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The same distributed architecture that creates exceptional detail perception (EPF) makes it harder to quickly integrate those details into a global summary (WCC). It's not two separate traits—it's the inevitable trade-off of high-resolution processing.</p>

    <p>DPM explains the architecture: dense local branching enhances detail encoding, but fragmented long-range connections make global integration challenging. WCC and EPF are both describing this same architectural pattern.</p>

    <h3>Granularity Theory: The Resolution Setting</h3>

    <p><strong>What the theory says:</strong> Granularity Theory proposes that autistic perception and cognition operate at finer granularity—smaller units of analysis, more micro-features, higher detail resolution.</p>

    <p><strong>How DPM connects it:</strong> This maps directly onto DPM's "representational density." Think of it like image resolution:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Standard resolution (neurotypical):</strong> 8 megapixel photo—captures the scene clearly, good for most purposes</li>
      <li><strong>High resolution (autistic):</strong> 40 megapixel photo—captures extraordinary detail invisible in standard photos</li>
    </ul>

    <p>More neural branches sampling the same stimulus = higher sampling resolution = finer granularity. Same concept, different terminology.</p>

    <p>Granularity Theory describes it from an information-processing perspective. DPM describes the neural implementation.</p>

    <h3>Minicolumn and Pruning Theories: The Physical Evidence</h3>

    <p><strong>What the theories say:</strong> Studies of autistic brain tissue have found physical differences:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Narrower cortical minicolumns (organizational units in the cortex)</li>
      <li>Altered inhibitory neuron patterns around these columns</li>
      <li>More synaptic connections (higher spine density)</li>
      <li>Evidence of less aggressive pruning during development</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>How DPM connects them:</strong> These anatomical findings provide physical evidence for what DPM proposes:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Higher spine density</strong> = the preserved extra connections that DPM describes</li>
      <li><strong>Narrower minicolumns with altered inhibition</strong> = the weaker "brake system" between processing units</li>
      <li><strong>Reduced pruning</strong> = the mechanism that preserves the extra pathways</li>
    </ul>

    <p>These are the anatomical structures—the physical wiring—that create distributed architecture. You can see them under a microscope in brain tissue.</p>

    <h3>Putting It All Together: One Architecture, Many Perspectives</h3>

    <p>Imagine you're looking at a building from different angles:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>From above (aerial view): You see the floor plan and layout</li>
      <li>From the side (street view): You see the façade and entrance</li>
      <li>From inside: You experience how the rooms feel</li>
      <li>From the blueprint: You see the structural engineering</li>
    </ul>

    <p>These are all views of the <em>same building</em>, just from different perspectives. Autism theories work the same way:</p>

    <table>

          <td><strong>WCC / EPF</strong></td>
          <td>Cognitive strengths and trade-offs</td>

          <td><strong>Intense World</strong></td>
          <td>What it feels like</td>
          <td>The lived experience of being in the building</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>DPM serves as the connecting framework—the floor plan that shows how all the other perspectives relate to each other. It explains:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>How genes affecting pruning and inhibition (molecular level)</li>
      <li>Create distributed branching patterns (circuit level)</li>
      <li>That produce high-resolution processing (computational level)</li>
      <li>Which manifests as intensity, detail focus, and sensory acuity (experiential level)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>These aren't competing explanations of different conditions. They're complementary perspectives on the same underlying neural architecture—your brain's unique wiring pattern and how it shapes every aspect of autistic experience.</p>

    <h3>Why This Matters</h3>

    <p>Understanding how these theories connect helps in several ways:</p>

    <p><strong>Makes sense of seemingly contradictory information:</strong> "Enhanced perception" and "weak coherence" aren't contradictory—they're two sides of the same architectural coin.</p>

    <p><strong>Explains your specific experience:</strong> You might relate strongly to some aspects (intense sensory experiences) and less to others (you might have good global integration in some domains). The framework shows why—distributed architecture expresses differently across brain regions.</p>

    <p><strong>Guides support strategies:</strong> Different theories suggest different interventions, but understanding how they connect shows which strategies address the same underlying architecture from different angles.</p>

    <p><strong>Validates lived experience:</strong> The intensity isn't in your head—it's in your neural architecture. The detail focus isn't a "deficit"—it's a computational trade-off. The framework shows that autistic experience is a coherent, explainable pattern, not random dysfunction.</p>

    <p>All these theories are describing your brain from different perspectives. DPM shows how they fit together into one coherent picture.</p>
