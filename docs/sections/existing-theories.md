    </p>

    <p>I have cited many theories and empirical strands throughout this document. Here I synthesize how they relate within the DPM framework, to avoid redundancy and to clarify complementarity rather than competition.</p>

    <h3>Excitation/Inhibition (E/I) Imbalance</h3>
    <p>E/I models describe why spillover is easier: reduced or delayed inhibition raises the probability that activity branches into reactive routes and persists. DPM treats E/I as the control parameter that sets the active:reactive ratio and the lifetime of reactive spread.</p>

    <h3>Intense World Theory</h3>
    <p>This emphasizes hyper-reactivity and hyper-plasticity. DPM provides the topology behind that intensity: dense local branching and distributed propagation naturally amplify input and promote local overlearning. "Intense" is the phenomenology; distributed pathways are the wiring.</p>

    <h3>Predictive Coding & HIPPEA (Precision Weighting)</h3>
    <p>HIPPEA proposes high sensory precision vs. priors. DPM explains how structure yields that precision: more local branches dedicate more neurons to encoding incoming data, making bottom-up signals heavier relative to top-down compression. Prediction errors propagate widely in DPM, raising the subjective cost of uncertainty.</p>

    <h3>Weak Central Coherence (WCC) and Enhanced Perceptual Functioning (EPF)</h3>
    <p>WCC notes reduced global integration; EPF notes superior local processing. DPM unifies them: branch-rich local networks (EPF) coupled with fragile long-range gating (WCC). Local coherence rises as global coherence becomes harder to sustain.</p>

    <h3>Kozima's Granularity Theory</h3>
    <p>Granularity maps directly to representational density in DPM: more micro-features are concurrently represented because branching increases the sampling resolution of each stimulus.</p>

    <h3>Minicolumn and Pruning Accounts</h3>
    <p>Findings of narrower minicolumns, altered inhibitory surrounds, and reduced pruning map to DPM's branch retention and weakened lateral gating, giving a histological anchor to the architecture.</p>

    <p>In short, DPM is not a rival to these accounts; it is a structural bridge. It explains how differences in pruning, inhibition, and channel dynamics manifest as distributed pathway behavior, from which the phenomenology (higher resolution, overload, creativity, replay) follows naturally.</p>

  <div id="tab-std" class="tab-panel">
    <p>The Distributed Pathway Model is not intended to replace existing autism theories but to provide a unifying structural framework that explains how diverse theoretical accounts relate to one another. Each established theory captures a different level or aspect of autistic cognition; DPM offers the circuit-level topology that connects them.</p>

    <p><strong>Excitation/Inhibition (E/I) Imbalance</strong> describes the regulatory mechanism that controls distributed propagation. Reduced or delayed inhibition makes it easier for activity to spill from active pathways into reactive branches and to persist longer. Within DPM, E/I balance acts as the control parameter governing the active:reactive ratio and the temporal persistence of spillover. E/I imbalance is not a separate dysfunction but the gating dynamic that enables distributed architecture to express itself.</p>

    <p><strong>Intense World Theory</strong> emphasizes hyper-reactivity and hyper-plasticity in autism. DPM provides the topological substrate for this intensity: when local branching is dense and propagation is distributed, the same input recruits more neurons and produces stronger, longer-lasting activations. The "intense" phenomenology arises naturally from architecture that samples stimuli at higher resolution and retains them through overlapping encodings. Intense World describes the experience; DPM describes the wiring that generates it.</p>

    <p><strong>Predictive Coding and HIPPEA (High, Inflexible Precision of Prediction Errors in Autism)</strong> propose that autistic cognition assigns unusually high precision-weighting to sensory input relative to learned priors. DPM explains this structurally: more local branches dedicate more neurons to representing bottom-up signals, making sensory data heavier in the prediction equation. When prediction errors occur, they propagate through distributed pathways, amplifying their subjective and computational cost. Precision-weighting in predictive coding thus maps directly onto representational density in DPM.</p>

    <p><strong>Weak Central Coherence (WCC)</strong> and <strong>Enhanced Perceptual Functioning (EPF)</strong> describe complementary aspects of autistic cognition—reduced global integration alongside superior local processing. DPM unifies them: locally dense branching enhances detail encoding (EPF), while weak long-range gating and fragmented synchrony limit global coherence (WCC). These are not separate traits but two sides of the same distributed architecture.</p>

    <p><strong>Kozima's Granularity Theory</strong> proposes that autistic perception operates at finer granularity. In DPM terms, granularity corresponds to representational density: branching allows more micro-features to be concurrently encoded, raising the sampling resolution of perception and cognition.</p>

    <p><strong>Minicolumn and Pruning Hypotheses</strong> provide histological grounding. Findings of narrower minicolumns, altered inhibitory surrounds, and reduced synaptic pruning align with DPM's prediction of retained local branches and weakened lateral inhibition. These structural differences anchor the model in measurable cortical anatomy.</p>

    <p>In summary, DPM is a <strong>structural bridge</strong> between molecular findings (genes, synapses, inhibition), circuit dynamics (branching, propagation, oscillations), and phenomenology (sensory intensity, cognitive depth, overload). It does not compete with existing theories but organizes them into a coherent topology, showing how each describes a different projection of the same underlying architecture.</p>

    <p>The Distributed Pathway Model doesn't aim to replace other theories of autism but to provide a framework that shows how they fit together. Each existing theory captures an important aspect of autistic experience; DPM offers the underlying brain architecture that connects them.</p>

    <p><strong>Excitation/Inhibition (E/I) Imbalance</strong> describes how the brain's control systems regulate signal spread. When inhibition is reduced or delayed, signals can more easily spill into multiple pathways and persist longer. In DPM terms, E/I balance determines how much reactive spread occurs and how long it lasts—it's the gating mechanism that allows distributed processing to happen.</p>

    <p><strong>Intense World Theory</strong> proposes that autistic individuals experience the world with heightened intensity—stronger reactions, deeper impressions, more persistent memories. DPM explains why: when more neurons encode the same input through distributed branching, the resulting experience is naturally more vivid and harder to downregulate. The intensity isn't arbitrary; it emerges from the architecture itself.</p>

    <p><strong>Predictive Coding theories</strong>, including HIPPEA, suggest that autistic cognition weighs sensory input more heavily than learned expectations. DPM provides the structural reason: more local branches mean more neurons dedicated to representing what's actually there (bottom-up signals) relative to what the brain expects based on past experience (top-down predictions). When reality doesn't match expectations, the discrepancy activates many pathways, making prediction errors feel more significant.</p>

    <p><strong>Weak Central Coherence</strong> and <strong>Enhanced Perceptual Functioning</strong> describe two complementary patterns in autism: difficulty integrating information globally alongside superior local detail processing. DPM shows these aren't separate traits but two faces of the same architecture—dense local branching enhances detail perception while fragmented long-range connections make global integration harder.</p>

    <p><strong>Granularity Theory</strong> proposes that autistic perception operates at a finer level of detail. In DPM, this corresponds directly to representational density: more neural branches sampling the same stimulus means higher resolution, like increasing the pixel count in an image.</p>

    <p><strong>Minicolumn and Pruning hypotheses</strong> describe structural brain differences—narrower minicolumns, altered inhibitory patterns, and less aggressive pruning of connections during development. These anatomical findings provide physical evidence for the branching patterns that DPM proposes.</p>

    <p>In essence, DPM serves as a connecting framework. It explains how molecular differences (genes affecting pruning and inhibition) create circuit-level changes (distributed branching) that produce the experiences described by other theories (intensity, precision-weighting, local detail focus). Rather than competing theories, these are different views of the same underlying architecture.</p>
