    <p>The Distributed Pathway Model provides the mechanistic substrate for the Higher-Resolution Hypothesis, describing how increased axonal and dendritic branching, combined with delayed or weakened inhibition, transforms signal propagation from streamlined pathways into distributed cascades.</p>

  <div id="tab-std" class="tab-panel">
    <p>The Distributed Pathway Model (DPM) proposes that autism arises from measurable shifts in neural topology: increased local branching during development, less aggressive synaptic pruning, and weaker or slower inhibitory gating. Together, these create an architecture where a single input can activate multiple downstream pathways rather than a single linear route (A → B → C <em>and</em> A → B → Y → Z). This distributed propagation increases representational density—more neurons encode finer differences within the same stimulus—yielding higher-resolution perception and cognition. However, it also raises temporal variability, energetic cost, and susceptibility to cascade activation. The model predicts local hyperconnectivity with long-range hypoconnectivity, altered oscillatory synchrony, and region-specific expression shaped by individual pruning and inhibition profiles. DPM is not a pathology framework but a topological description: it explains how information flows differently through autistic circuits, producing both exceptional precision and vulnerability to overload as natural consequences of the same branching structure.</p>

  <div id="tab-gen" class="tab-panel">
    <p>In most brains, neurons connect in relatively straight lines: one signal triggers one predictable outcome. In the autistic brain, development preserves extra branches at key junctions, so a single input can split into multiple parallel routes. This creates a kind of "high-definition" perception—you notice subtle details others miss—but it also means the brain is juggling more active signals at once. When inhibitory controls (the brain's "off switches") are slower or weaker, these extra signals can echo longer, making it harder to filter noise or shift focus. The result is a system that sees and thinks in finer detail but at greater energetic cost and with heightened sensitivity to chaos.</p>
