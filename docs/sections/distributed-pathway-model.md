    <p>The Distributed Pathway Model provides the mechanistic substrate for the Higher-Resolution Hypothesis, describing how increased axonal and dendritic branching, combined with delayed or weakened inhibition, transforms signal propagation from streamlined pathways into distributed cascades.</p>

  <div id="tab-std" class="tab-panel">
    <p>The Distributed Pathway Model (DPM) proposes that autism arises from measurable shifts in neural topology: increased local branching during development, less aggressive synaptic pruning, and weaker or slower inhibitory gating. Together, these create an architecture where a single input can activate multiple downstream pathways rather than a single linear route (A → B → C <em>and</em> A → B → Y → Z). This distributed propagation increases representational density—more neurons encode finer differences within the same stimulus—yielding higher-resolution perception and cognition. However, it also raises temporal variability, energetic cost, and susceptibility to cascade activation. The model predicts local hyperconnectivity with long-range hypoconnectivity, altered oscillatory synchrony, and region-specific expression shaped by individual pruning and inhibition profiles. DPM is not a pathology framework but a topological description: it explains how information flows differently through autistic circuits, producing both exceptional precision and vulnerability to overload as natural consequences of the same branching structure.</p>

  <div id="tab-gen" class="tab-panel">
    <p>In typical neural development, connections between neurons are streamlined through pruning, creating relatively direct pathways where one signal produces one predictable response. In autistic neurodevelopment, this pruning is less aggressive, preserving additional branches at critical junctions. As a result, a single input can activate multiple parallel routes rather than following a single pathway.</p>

    <p>This architectural difference creates what can be understood as higher-resolution information processing. Autistic individuals often detect subtle details, patterns, and sensory distinctions that others do not register. However, this same architecture means the brain maintains more concurrent activations, requiring greater resources to manage. When inhibitory control—the neural mechanisms that terminate or contain signals—develops more slowly or operates less efficiently, these additional activations persist longer than in typical brains. This makes it more difficult to filter irrelevant information or transition between tasks.</p>

    <p>This distributed architecture is not a dysfunction but a different mode of neural organization, one that produces both capabilities and challenges. Enhanced pattern detection and sensory acuity coexist with increased vulnerability to overload and reduced efficiency in task-switching. The substantial variability in how autism manifests across individuals reflects differences in where and how extensively this branching develops, creating distinct cognitive and perceptual profiles.</p>
