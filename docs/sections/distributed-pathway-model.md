    <h2>The Distributed Pathway Model: Mechanistic Foundation</h2>

    <p>The Distributed Pathway Model (DPM) provides the mechanistic substrate for the Higher-Resolution Hypothesis, describing how measurable shifts in neural topology—increased axonal and dendritic branching, and weakened inhibitory gating—transform signal propagation from streamlined isolated networks into cross-network cascades. This architectural reconfiguration produces higher-resolution information processing: more neurons across multiple functional systems encode finer distinctions per stimulus, yielding exceptional perceptual and cognitive capabilities alongside increased energetic cost, temporal variability, and vulnerability to cascade activation across functional boundaries.</p>

    <h3>Topological Foundation: Branching, Pruning, and Lifelong Collateral Formation</h3>

    <p>During typical neurodevelopment, initial exuberant synaptogenesis is followed by extensive synaptic pruning that eliminates redundant or weakly-activated connections, streamlining neural pathways. In autism, multiple mechanisms contribute to increased branching: reduced pruning is one factor—empirical evidence includes higher spine density in cortical pyramidal neurons post-mortem, increased gray matter volume in childhood persisting into adolescence, and elevated synaptic protein expression. However, ongoing collateral formation and atypical stabilization of newly formed synapses throughout life also contribute significantly, extending distributed propagation beyond early developmental periods. The result is preservation and continuous generation of additional collateral branches at neural junctions, creating a topology where a single presynaptic input can activate multiple partially-overlapping postsynaptic ensembles rather than converging on a single dominant pathway.</p>

    <p>This branching creates representational redundancy and cross-network connections: the same stimulus activates multiple partially distinct neural populations spanning different functional systems, each encoding slightly different features or contextual associations. At the circuit level, this manifests as local hyperconnectivity—denser short-range connections within local modules—coexisting with aberrant cross-network connections that allow signals to bleed between systems that should remain isolated. fMRI and DTI studies confirm this pattern: increased short-range correlations, decreased long-range functional connectivity, and evidence of atypical cross-domain activation in autism.</p>

    <h3>Inhibitory Gating: Timing and Strength</h3>

    <p>Distributed propagation is further amplified by altered inhibitory control. GABAergic interneurons, particularly parvalbumin-positive (PV+) and somatostatin-positive (SST+) populations, normally provide feedforward and feedback inhibition that constrains signal spread. In autism, multiple lines of evidence suggest E/I imbalance toward excitation: reduced GABAergic signaling markers, altered GABA receptor expression, delayed maturation of inhibitory circuits, and increased excitatory:inhibitory neuron ratios in some cortical regions.</p>

    <p>Critically, even modest reductions in inhibitory strength or delays in inhibitory timing allow distributed activation to persist longer. Signals that would normally be suppressed within tens of milliseconds continue propagating for hundreds of milliseconds, engaging additional downstream circuits before termination. This creates temporal spreading: activation windows expand, making it difficult to segregate sequential inputs and reducing the system's temporal resolution despite increased spatial and featural resolution.</p>

    <h3>Oscillatory Consequences</h3>

    <p>Distributed branching with weak inhibition fundamentally alters network oscillations. Gamma oscillations (30-80 Hz), generated by PV+ interneuron-pyramidal neuron loops, show reduced power and coherence in autism—consistent with PV+ dysfunction. Reduced gamma synchrony impairs local circuit binding and temporal coordination. Beta oscillations (13-30 Hz), involved in top-down control, similarly show alterations. Conversely, some studies report enhanced or prolonged alpha/theta activity, potentially reflecting compensatory mechanisms or alternative coordination strategies.</p>

    <p>The net effect is asynchronous activation across distributed pathways: instead of coherent oscillatory packets organizing information flow, multiple semi-autonomous populations activate with variable phase relationships. This reduces binding efficiency but increases informational capacity—more independent representations can coexist, at the cost of coordination difficulty.</p>

    <h3>Predictive Coding Interpretation</h3>

    <p>In predictive coding frameworks, DPM architecture shifts the balance between bottom-up precision and top-down prediction. Increased local branching dedicates more neurons to encoding sensory features, effectively raising precision-weighting of bottom-up signals. Reduced long-range connectivity and weak hierarchical inhibition limit the influence of top-down priors. The system thus favors data-driven processing over model-driven compression, producing exceptional accuracy under consistent conditions but difficulty generalizing under ambiguity.</p>

    <h3>Active vs. Reactive Pathways</h3>

    <p>Not all distributed pathways operate identically. DPM distinguishes between active pathways—those engaging executive control, working memory, and volitional action—and reactive pathways—those operating relatively autonomously (sensory-motor loops, emotional-associative circuits, memory reactivation). The relative balance of active:reactive branching varies across individuals and brain regions, explaining heterogeneity in phenotypic expression. Individuals with more active-dominant branching may show enhanced executive function but increased cognitive load. Those with reactive-dominant branching may show exceptional perceptual abilities but greater difficulty with volitional regulation.</p>

    <h3>Emergent Phenomenology</h3>

    <p>From these topological and physiological foundations emerge the cognitive and perceptual features characteristic of autism: exceptional detail perception (more neurons per stimulus), sensory overload (insufficient filtering), task-switching difficulty (persistent prior activation), decision paralysis (competing activations), enhanced pattern recognition (redundant encoding), predictability preference (minimizing prediction error across distributed pathways), special interests (stability zones), stimming (reactive motor cascade), and energetic collapse (ATP demand exceeding supply).</p>

    <p>Critically, DPM is not a deficit model. It describes a different neural architecture with distinct computational properties—one where functional boundaries between processing systems are more permeable. The same cross-network topology that produces challenges (multi-domain interference, sensory cross-talk) under high load enables exceptional capabilities (integrative insights, synesthetic richness) under optimal conditions. Understanding autism through DPM reframes intervention: the goal is accommodating cross-network processing rather than forcing functional isolation.</p></invoke>

    <h2>How Neural Architecture Shapes Information Processing</h2>

The distributed pathway model.</strong> A single input (A) activates multiple parallel pathways through branch point B, creating higher representational density—more neurons encode each stimulus—yielding exceptional detail perception alongside increased processing demands.</em></p>
    </div>

    <p>The Distributed Pathway Model (DPM) describes the fundamental neural architecture underlying autistic cognition. It proposes that autism arises from measurable shifts in how neural circuits develop and operate: more branching connections, and weaker inhibitory control that allows signals to spread more broadly.</p>

    <h3>Branching Topology: One Input, Multiple Routes</h3>

    <p>During typical neurodevelopment, initial abundant connections between neurons are streamlined through pruning, eliminating redundant or weakly-used pathways. This creates relatively direct routes where information follows predictable paths (A → B → C). In autism, reduced pruning is one contributing factor—empirical evidence includes higher spine density, increased gray matter volume persisting into adolescence, and elevated synaptic protein expression. Additionally, ongoing collateral formation and atypical stabilization of new synapses throughout life further increase branching, extending distributed propagation beyond early developmental periods.</p>

    <p>The result is preservation of additional collateral branches at neural junctions. A single input can now activate multiple partially-overlapping downstream pathways rather than converging on one dominant route (A → B → C <em>and</em> A → B → Y → Z). This creates representational redundancy: the same stimulus activates multiple neural populations, each encoding slightly different features or associations.</p>

    <p>At the circuit level, this manifests as local hyperconnectivity—denser short-range connections within local brain modules—coexisting with long-range hypoconnectivity due to reduced hierarchical integration across distant regions. Brain imaging studies confirm this pattern: increased short-range correlations and decreased long-range functional connectivity.</p>

    <h3>Inhibitory Gating: Delayed or Weakened Signal Termination</h3>

    <p>Distributed propagation is amplified by altered inhibitory control. Inhibitory neurons normally act as brakes, constraining how far signals spread and how long they persist. In autism, multiple lines of evidence suggest these brakes operate more weakly or slowly: reduced GABAergic signaling markers, altered inhibitory receptor expression, delayed maturation of inhibitory circuits.</p>

    <p>Even modest reductions in inhibitory strength allow distributed activation to persist longer. Signals that would normally be suppressed within tens of milliseconds continue propagating for hundreds of milliseconds, engaging additional downstream circuits before termination. This creates temporal spreading—activation windows expand, making it difficult to segregate sequential inputs despite increased spatial resolution.</p>

    <h3>Higher Resolution, Higher Cost</h3>

    <p>This distributed architecture increases representational density: more neurons encode finer distinctions per stimulus, yielding higher-resolution perception and cognition. Autistic individuals often detect subtle patterns, sensory distinctions, and informational details that compressed processing would miss.</p>

    <p>However, this resolution comes with costs:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Energetic demand:</strong> More neurons firing per input means higher ATP consumption</li>
      <li><strong>Temporal variability:</strong> Asynchronous pathways create coordination challenges</li>
      <li><strong>Cascade vulnerability:</strong> Weak inhibition allows activation to spread broadly</li>
      <li><strong>Filtering difficulty:</strong> More signals persist, making it harder to suppress irrelevant information</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Active vs. Reactive Pathways</h3>

    <p>Not all distributed pathways operate identically. DPM distinguishes between active pathways (executive control, working memory, volitional action) and reactive pathways (sensory-motor loops, emotional-associative circuits, autonomous processing). The relative balance varies across individuals and brain regions, explaining phenotypic heterogeneity. More active branching may enhance executive function but increase cognitive load; more reactive branching may enhance perception but reduce volitional control.</p>

    <h3>Not Deficit, But Different</h3>

    <p>DPM is not a deficit model—it describes a different neural architecture with distinct computational properties. The same distributed topology that produces challenges under high load enables exceptional capabilities under optimal conditions. Exceptional detail perception, pattern recognition, and sensory acuity emerge from the same branching structure that creates overload vulnerability and filtering difficulty.</p>

    <p>Understanding autism through DPM reframes intervention: the goal is accommodating distributed processing rather than forcing hierarchical compression. When environments support distributed architecture—reduced concurrent demands, predictable patterns, sensory accommodations—the exceptional capabilities of high-resolution processing can emerge without the costs of constant overload.</p>

    <h2>The Core Difference: How Your Brain Is Wired</h2>

    <div style="text-align:center; margin: 2rem 0;">
      <img src="../../diagrams/dpm-comparison-side-by-side.svg" alt="The Distributed Pathway Model" style="max-width:500px; width:50%; height:auto;">
      <p style="margin-top: 1rem;"><em><strong>The distributed pathway model.</strong> Information follows multiple parallel routes instead of a single main path. This creates richer detail but requires more energy and coordination.</em></p>
    </div>

    <p>The Distributed Pathway Model explains the fundamental way the autistic brain is structured differently from neurotypical brains—and why this creates both exceptional abilities and genuine challenges.</p>

    <h3>More Pathways: Reduced Pruning Plus Ongoing Growth</h3>

    <p>Think of your brain like a city's road network. When the city is first built, there are roads everywhere—many possible routes to get from any place to any other place. As the city develops, urban planners remove redundant roads to make traffic flow more efficiently, keeping only the most useful routes.</p>

    <p>In typical brain development, this "pruning" happens extensively. The baby brain starts with an enormous number of connections between neurons, then eliminates many of them during childhood and adolescence, streamlining pathways. By adulthood, information tends to flow along well-established, efficient routes.</p>

    <p>In autistic brain development, two things happen: First, this pruning is less aggressive—more of those extra connections are kept. Second, and importantly, the brain continues building new collateral roads throughout life, with new connections being stabilized in ways that don't happen as much in typical brains. This means that when information enters your brain, instead of flowing down one main highway, it can flow down multiple interconnected roads simultaneously—and those roads keep expanding over time, not just in childhood.</p>

    <p><strong>Example:</strong> A sound enters your ear. In a neurotypical brain, the signal might follow one primary pathway to be processed and categorized. In your brain, that same sound might activate multiple pathways simultaneously—one analyzing its pitch, another its timbre, another its emotional associations, another comparing it to similar sounds you've heard before, all happening at once through preserved neural connections.</p>

    <h3>Cross-Network Spillover: The Key Insight</h3>

    <p>Think of your brain as having many specialized departments: visual processing, sound processing, movement planning, emotional responses. In most brains, these departments work independently—a signal in the visual department stays in the visual department. In autistic brains, the connections between departments weren't pruned as aggressively during development. Now when the visual department activates, signals can spill over into the sound department, the emotion department, or the movement department. This explains why a bright light (visual) might trigger sound sensitivity, emotional reactions, or the urge to move (stimming). It's not that each system is broken—it's that the boundaries between systems are more permeable.</p>

    <p>This cross-network architecture explains autism's multi-domain presentation: activation in one functional system (e.g., visual processing) can inadvertently recruit circuits in another (e.g., emotional processing, motor planning, or auditory encoding). These aren't separate symptoms—they're unified by the same underlying topology of cross-network spillover.</p>

    <h3>Why This Creates "Higher Resolution"</h3>

    <p>Because more neurons across multiple systems are activated by the same input, your brain is capturing more information—more detail, more nuance, more dimensions of the stimulus, often spanning functional domains that would remain separate in neurotypical brains. It's like the difference between a standard photo and a high-resolution photo:</p>

    <p><strong>Standard photo (8 megapixels):</strong> Captures the main image clearly, good enough for most purposes, processes quickly<br>
    <strong>High-resolution photo (40 megapixels):</strong> Captures extraordinary detail invisible in the standard photo, but creates much larger file sizes, takes longer to process, requires more storage and computing power</p>

    <p>Your brain is the high-resolution camera. You notice details others miss—subtle patterns, minute changes, fine distinctions—because you're genuinely capturing more information.</p>

    <h3>The Brake System: Inhibitory Control</h3>

    <p>Now imagine those multiple pathways the information is flowing through. In typical brains, there's a strong "brake system"—inhibitory neurons that quickly stop signals from spreading too far or lasting too long. These brakes keep activation contained.</p>

    <p>In autistic brains, these brakes tend to engage more slowly or less strongly. This means:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Signals spread to more areas than they would in typical brains</li>
      <li>Activation lasts longer before being shut down</li>
      <li>Information keeps processing when it would have already stopped in typical brains</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This amplifies the distributed processing—not only do you have more pathways, but signals flow through them longer and spread further.</p>

    <h3>The Trade-offs</h3>

    <p><strong>What this distributed architecture enables:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Noticing subtle details others miss (more neurons capturing more dimensions)</li>
      <li>Detecting patterns in complex data (redundant encoding across pathways)</li>
      <li>Exceptional accuracy when patterns are consistent (high-resolution detection)</li>
      <li>Deep, systematic understanding of areas of interest (extensive neural encoding)</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>What this distributed architecture makes challenging:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Filtering out irrelevant information (more signals persist, harder to suppress)</li>
      <li>Switching between tasks (need to deactivate many pathways, not just one)</li>
      <li>Managing concurrent demands (multiple pathways active simultaneously)</li>
      <li>Energy management (more neurons firing means more fuel consumption)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Why People Experience Autism So Differently</h3>

    <p>The distributed pathways don't develop identically in everyone's brain. There are two key types:</p>

    <p><strong>Active pathways:</strong> Involve conscious control, decision-making, working memory, volitional action—the parts you control deliberately</p>

    <p><strong>Reactive pathways:</strong> Operate more automatically—sensory processing, emotional responses, motor patterns, memory associations</p>

    <p>Different people have different balances:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>More active branching:</strong> May have strong executive function and working memory but experience high cognitive load and mental exhaustion</li>
      <li><strong>More reactive branching:</strong> May have exceptional sensory and perceptual abilities but more difficulty with voluntary control and regulation</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This balance also varies by brain region—someone might have extensive distributed pathways in sensory areas (heightened sensory perception) but less in motor areas, or vice versa. This is why autism looks so different across individuals—the distributed architecture expresses differently based on where and how extensively the extra pathways were preserved.</p>

    <h3>Not Broken, Different</h3>

    <p>This distributed architecture isn't a malfunction or damage—it's a different way of being wired with different strengths and costs.</p>

    <p>A highway system with fewer, larger roads (typical brain):</p>
    <ul>
      <li>+ Traffic flows efficiently in predictable patterns</li>
      <li>+ Easy to manage and redirect</li>
      <li>- Captures less local detail</li>
      <li>- Misses subtle variations</li>
    </ul>

    <p>A road network with many interconnected smaller roads (autistic brain):</p>
    <ul>
      <li>+ Captures rich local detail</li>
      <li>+ Notices patterns others miss</li>
      <li>- Requires more energy to operate</li>
      <li>- Harder to coordinate efficiently</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Neither is better or worse—they're optimized for different things. The autistic brain excels at high-resolution processing, pattern detection, and detail capture but requires more energy and supportive environments to operate optimally. When environments accommodate distributed processing—predictable patterns, reduced concurrent demands, sensory accommodations—the exceptional capabilities can emerge without constant overload.</p>

    <h3>The Foundation for Everything Else</h3>

    <p>This distributed pathway architecture is the foundation that explains all the other features of autism described in this framework:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Why sensory experiences are more intense (more neurons processing each stimulus)</li>
      <li>Why routine and predictability matter (minimizing prediction errors across many pathways)</li>
      <li>Why tasks feel more complex (decompose into more steps through distributed processing)</li>
      <li>Why social situations are overwhelming (too many signals processed simultaneously)</li>
      <li>Why energy runs out (higher metabolic cost of distributed activation)</li>
      <li>Why stimming occurs (reactive motor cascade when distributed activation spills into motor circuits)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Understanding your brain through this lens isn't about fixing what's broken—it's about understanding how your neural architecture works so you can work with it rather than against it.</p>
