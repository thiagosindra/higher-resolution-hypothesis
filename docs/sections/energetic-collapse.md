    <p>Collapse states emerge from metabolic exhaustion when distributed competing activations scale ATP demand beyond mitochondrial and glial buffering capacity, forcing transient functional failure—not as regulatory choice but as biophysical depletion threshold.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="tab-std" class="tab-panel">
    <p>Distributed propagation not only taxes inhibitory control but also depletes metabolic resources. Each branching cascade engages more neurons and synapses per unit of experience, increasing ATP consumption and glial support demand. When distributed pathways compete concurrently—during predictive overload, sensory saturation, or prolonged executive strain—energy demand scales nonlinearly. Mitochondrial ATP production and glial buffering (lactate shuttle, ion homeostasis) have fixed upper limits. When excitation persists beyond these metabolic replenishment rates, local energy deficits accumulate in cortical microcircuits, leading to transient functional collapse.</p>

    <p><strong>Shutdowns</strong> represent the system reaching energy depletion: neural firing ceases not as a protective choice but because ATP reserves cannot sustain synaptic transmission. Circuits transiently silence to allow metabolic restoration—lactate clearance, ion gradient re-establishment, mitochondrial recovery. <strong>Meltdowns</strong> occur when distributed excitatory spread recruits emotional, sensory, and motor regions simultaneously before metabolic limits are reached, producing uncontrollable behavioral output—emotional dysregulation, motor agitation, or sensory flooding—followed by collapse. Both reflect emergent metabolic phenomena within a high-resolution, high-demand neural architecture. Future research integrating cortical energy metabolism imaging, mitochondrial efficiency measures, and glial buffering capacity may clarify individual vulnerability thresholds and recovery dynamics.</p>

  <div id="tab-gen" class="tab-panel">
    <p>Think of your brain as a city running on limited power. Each thought, sensation, and prediction consumes electricity. In a distributed system, you're not running one task but dozens of mini-tasks in parallel—each drawing power. Normally, the power plant (mitochondria) and backup batteries (glial cells) can keep up. But when too many circuits fire at once for too long, demand outpaces supply. The grid browns out.</p>

    <p><strong>Shutdown</strong> is what happens when the power literally runs out: neurons can't fire anymore because the fuel (ATP) is gone. This isn't the brain "deciding" to shut down for protection—it's the system hitting empty. Circuits go silent, thought slows or stops, and you may lose speech, movement, or emotional regulation. <strong>Meltdown</strong> happens when the overload spreads to emotional and motor regions <em>before</em> the fuel runs out, triggering uncontrolled output—crying, shouting, pacing—as those circuits discharge their excess activation. Then collapse follows. Both are metabolic realities of running a high-resolution brain past its energetic limits, not psychological responses or choices.</p>
