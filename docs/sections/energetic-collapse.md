    <p>Collapse states emerge from metabolic exhaustion when distributed competing activations scale ATP demand beyond mitochondrial and glial buffering capacity, forcing transient functional failure—not as regulatory choice but as biophysical depletion threshold.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="tab-std" class="tab-panel">
    <p>Distributed propagation not only taxes inhibitory control but also depletes metabolic resources. Each branching cascade engages more neurons and synapses per unit of experience, increasing ATP consumption and glial support demand. When distributed pathways compete concurrently—during predictive overload, sensory saturation, or prolonged executive strain—energy demand scales nonlinearly. Mitochondrial ATP production and glial buffering (lactate shuttle, ion homeostasis) have fixed upper limits. When excitation persists beyond these metabolic replenishment rates, local energy deficits accumulate in cortical microcircuits, leading to transient functional collapse.</p>

    <p><strong>Shutdowns</strong> represent the system reaching energy depletion: neural firing ceases not as a protective choice but because ATP reserves cannot sustain synaptic transmission. Circuits transiently silence to allow metabolic restoration—lactate clearance, ion gradient re-establishment, mitochondrial recovery. <strong>Meltdowns</strong> occur when distributed excitatory spread recruits emotional, sensory, and motor regions simultaneously before metabolic limits are reached, producing uncontrollable behavioral output—emotional dysregulation, motor agitation, or sensory flooding—followed by collapse. Both reflect emergent metabolic phenomena within a high-resolution, high-demand neural architecture. Future research integrating cortical energy metabolism imaging, mitochondrial efficiency measures, and glial buffering capacity may clarify individual vulnerability thresholds and recovery dynamics.</p>

  <div id="tab-gen" class="tab-panel">
    <p>Neural activity requires continuous energy supply in the form of ATP, which is generated primarily through mitochondrial metabolism. In distributed neural architecture, each cognitive or perceptual event engages substantially more neurons and synaptic connections than in typical brains. This broader recruitment increases ATP consumption proportionally. When multiple demands occur concurrently—sensory processing, cognitive tasks, emotional regulation, and prediction updating—energy demand scales rapidly.</p>

    <p>The brain's capacity to generate ATP and maintain the ionic gradients necessary for neural firing has biological limits. Mitochondria can only produce energy at a certain rate, and glial cells can only buffer ions and provide metabolic support up to a threshold. When concurrent distributed activations push energy demand beyond these supply limits for sustained periods, local energy deficits accumulate in affected circuits.</p>

    <p><strong>Shutdowns</strong> occur when these energy deficits reach critical levels. Neural circuits cease functioning not through voluntary control but because insufficient ATP remains to sustain synaptic transmission and action potentials. The inability to process information, speak, move, or regulate normally during shutdown reflects genuine metabolic depletion. The brain essentially enforces rest to allow ATP regeneration, ion gradient restoration, and clearance of metabolic byproducts.</p>

    <p><strong>Meltdowns</strong> represent a different trajectory within the same energetic framework. When distributed excitation spreads rapidly through emotional, sensory, and motor systems before metabolic limits force cessation, the result is uncontrolled behavioral output—emotional dysregulation, motor agitation, or sensory overwhelm—followed by collapse once energy reserves are exhausted. The behavioral expression differs, but the underlying mechanism is the same: metabolic demand exceeding supply capacity.</p>

    <p>Both collapse states reflect biophysical limits rather than psychological responses. Recovery requires time for actual physiological restoration—ATP synthesis, ionic balance, and metabolic waste removal. Understanding these states as energetic phenomena rather than behavioral choices or failures of emotional regulation is essential for appropriate support and accommodation.</p>
