    <p>Collapse states emerge from metabolic exhaustion when distributed competing activations scale ATP demand beyond mitochondrial and glial buffering capacity, forcing transient functional failure—not as regulatory choice but as biophysical depletion threshold.</p>

  <div id="tab-std" class="tab-panel">
    <p>Distributed propagation not only taxes inhibitory control but also depletes metabolic resources. Each branching cascade engages more neurons and synapses per unit of experience, increasing ATP consumption and glial support demand. When distributed pathways compete concurrently—during predictive overload, sensory saturation, or prolonged executive strain—energy demand scales nonlinearly. Mitochondrial ATP production and glial buffering (lactate shuttle, ion homeostasis) have fixed upper limits. When excitation persists beyond these metabolic replenishment rates, local energy deficits accumulate in cortical microcircuits, leading to transient functional collapse.</p>

    <p><strong>Shutdowns</strong> represent the system reaching energy depletion: neural firing ceases not as a protective choice but because ATP reserves cannot sustain synaptic transmission. Circuits transiently silence to allow metabolic restoration—lactate clearance, ion gradient re-establishment, mitochondrial recovery. <strong>Meltdowns</strong> occur when distributed excitatory spread recruits emotional, sensory, and motor regions simultaneously before metabolic limits are reached, producing uncontrollable behavioral output—emotional dysregulation, motor agitation, or sensory flooding—followed by collapse. Both reflect emergent metabolic phenomena within a high-resolution, high-demand neural architecture. Future research integrating cortical energy metabolism imaging, mitochondrial efficiency measures, and glial buffering capacity may clarify individual vulnerability thresholds and recovery dynamics.</p>

    <p>Think of your brain as a city running on limited power. Each thought, sensation, and prediction consumes electricity. In a distributed system, the same task uses more power because more neighborhoods are active at once. When too many things happen simultaneously—sensory overload, unpredictability, prolonged focus—the power demand spikes. Your brain's generators (mitochondria) and backup batteries (glial cells) have a ceiling: they can only supply so much energy per minute. When demand exceeds supply for too long, circuits start to brown out. A <strong>shutdown</strong> is when the power fails completely: you can't think, speak, or move normally because there's literally no fuel left for those circuits. Your brain forces a blackout to recharge. A <strong>meltdown</strong> is when overload hits the emotional and motor systems before the shutdown can happen—everything fires at once in a chaotic surge, then collapses. Neither is a choice or a failure of willpower. They're biological limits: the high-resolution system ran out of gas. Recovery takes time because the brain has to physically restore chemical balance and energy reserves.</p>
