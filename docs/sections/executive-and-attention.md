    <p>The executive-predictive-energetic cascade: when distributed pathways exceed synchronization capacity, executive gating fails; competing activations destabilize predictive coherence; and unresolved interference escalates metabolic demand beyond supply, forcing functional collapse.</p>

  <div id="tab-std" class="tab-panel">
    <p>In a distributed architecture, attention naturally spreads across multiple stimuli because many pathways remain active simultaneously. Sustaining focus on a single target demands continuous inhibitory suppression of competing branches—a metabolically expensive process. Distributed activations also persist longer due to weak gating, producing cognitive inertia: switching tasks requires fully deactivating prior states rather than simply redirecting attention. When too many pathways remain active concurrently, the executive system exceeds its capacity to synchronize competing signals, leading to <strong>executive overload</strong>.</p>

    <p>As executive control falters, distributed competition extends inward to destabilize predictive processing itself. Multiple semi-autonomous predictive streams—each generating forward expectations based on local circuit states—remain active without resolution, creating <strong>predictive interference</strong>. The system faces numerous partial mismatches simultaneously; each unresolved prediction re-propagates through distributed circuits, amplifying noise and uncertainty. This informational instability directly increases metabolic cost: competing predictions must be evaluated and updated concurrently, scaling ATP demand nonlinearly. When predictive overload persists alongside executive strain, the system enters a critical state where energy supply cannot sustain distributed activity. The cascade from executive strain through predictive overload to <strong>energetic collapse</strong> reflects how coordination failure at one level propagates through the entire distributed architecture, ultimately exceeding metabolic thresholds.</p>

  <div id="tab-gen" class="tab-panel">
    <p>Think of your attention as a spotlight trying to illuminate one thing while dimming dozens of others. In a distributed system, those "others" don't dim easily—they keep glowing faintly in the background, each demanding a bit of mental energy to suppress. Focusing on a single task becomes exhausting because you're constantly fighting those persistent signals. Switching tasks is even harder: you can't just redirect the spotlight—you have to fully power down the old scene first, which takes time and effort. When too many things compete for attention at once, your brain's coordination system gets overwhelmed. This isn't just "distraction"—it's your executive system literally running out of bandwidth to juggle conflicting signals. What's worse, this confusion spreads inward: your brain generates multiple conflicting predictions about what should happen next, and can't resolve them. Each unresolved question drains more energy, until the whole system hits a wall and either shuts down (can't process anything) or melts down (can't stop processing everything). It's not a choice—it's the power grid failing under too much load.</p>
