    <p>The executive-predictive-energetic cascade: when distributed pathways exceed synchronization capacity, executive gating fails; competing activations destabilize predictive coherence; and unresolved interference escalates metabolic demand beyond supply, forcing functional collapse.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="tab-std" class="tab-panel">
    <p>In a distributed architecture, attention naturally spreads across multiple stimuli because many pathways remain active simultaneously. Sustaining focus on a single target demands continuous inhibitory suppression of competing branches—a metabolically expensive process. Distributed activations also persist longer due to weak gating, producing cognitive inertia: switching tasks requires fully deactivating prior states rather than simply redirecting attention. When too many pathways remain active concurrently, the executive system exceeds its capacity to synchronize competing signals, leading to <strong>executive overload</strong>.</p>

    <p>As executive control falters, distributed competition extends inward to destabilize predictive processing itself. Multiple semi-autonomous predictive streams—each generating forward expectations based on local circuit states—remain active without resolution, creating <strong>predictive interference</strong>. The system faces numerous partial mismatches simultaneously; each unresolved prediction re-propagates through distributed circuits, amplifying noise and uncertainty. This transition from executive strain to <strong>predictive overload</strong> marks the shift from coordination failure to informational chaos—the brain cannot decide which internal model to trust.</p>

    <p>Crucially, predictive overload drives <strong>energetic collapse</strong>. Each competing predictive branch consumes ATP to sustain its activation; as their number grows, metabolic demand scales nonlinearly while supply remains fixed. When local energy reserves (mitochondrial ATP, glial buffering) cannot keep pace, neural firing fails—not as a protective "choice" but as direct metabolic exhaustion. <strong>Shutdowns</strong> reflect this depletion threshold: circuits transiently silence to restore energy homeostasis. <strong>Meltdowns</strong> occur when excitatory spread recruits emotional and motor regions before collapse, producing uncontrollable output. Both are emergent metabolic phenomena within a high-resolution, high-demand neural architecture.</p>

  <div id="tab-gen" class="tab-panel">
    <p>Imagine your brain trying to juggle ten thoughts at once, each demanding attention. Focusing on just one requires actively pushing the others aside—exhausting work when they keep popping back up. Task switching becomes harder because old tasks linger, refusing to fully "close." This is <strong>executive overload</strong>: too many threads running at once.</p>

    <p>When executive control slips, the chaos moves deeper. Your brain constantly predicts what's coming next, but now multiple prediction systems are firing conflicting guesses—each insisting it's right. You lose the ability to settle on a single interpretation. Perception feels unstable, meaning fragments. This is <strong>predictive overload</strong>: not just too much input, but too many competing internal models fighting for control.</p>

    <p>Each of those competing predictions burns energy. As they multiply, your brain's fuel supply can't keep up. Neurons begin to fail—not by choice, but because they've literally run out of gas. <strong>Shutdown</strong> is what happens when the system browns out from energy exhaustion. <strong>Meltdown</strong> is when the overflow spreads to emotional and motor areas before the crash. Neither is a deliberate protective response; both are the metabolic cost of running a high-resolution system past its energetic limits.</p>
