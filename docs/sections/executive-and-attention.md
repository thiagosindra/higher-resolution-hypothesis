    <p>The executive-predictive-energetic cascade: when distributed pathways exceed synchronization capacity, executive gating fails; competing activations destabilize predictive coherence; and unresolved interference escalates metabolic demand beyond supply, forcing functional collapse.</p>

  <div id="tab-std" class="tab-panel">
    <p>In a distributed architecture, attention naturally spreads across multiple stimuli because many pathways remain active simultaneously. Sustaining focus on a single target demands continuous inhibitory suppression of competing branches—a metabolically expensive process. Distributed activations also persist longer due to weak gating, producing cognitive inertia: switching tasks requires fully deactivating prior states rather than simply redirecting attention. When too many pathways remain active concurrently, the executive system exceeds its capacity to synchronize competing signals, leading to <strong>executive overload</strong>.</p>

    <p>As executive control falters, distributed competition extends inward to destabilize predictive processing itself. Multiple semi-autonomous predictive streams—each generating forward expectations based on local circuit states—remain active without resolution, creating <strong>predictive interference</strong>. The system faces numerous partial mismatches simultaneously; each unresolved prediction re-propagates through distributed circuits, amplifying noise and uncertainty. This informational instability directly increases metabolic cost: competing predictions must be evaluated and updated concurrently, scaling ATP demand nonlinearly. When predictive overload persists alongside executive strain, the system enters a critical state where energy supply cannot sustain distributed activity. The cascade from executive strain through predictive overload to <strong>energetic collapse</strong> reflects how coordination failure at one level propagates through the entire distributed architecture, ultimately exceeding metabolic thresholds.</p>

  <div id="tab-gen" class="tab-panel">
    <p>In distributed neural architecture, attention naturally distributes across multiple stimuli because many pathways remain concurrently active. Maintaining focus on a single target requires sustained inhibitory effort to suppress competing signals—a process that consumes significant metabolic resources. Unlike typical attention systems where irrelevant stimuli fade quickly, distributed architecture maintains partial activation of multiple inputs simultaneously, making sustained selective attention metabolically expensive and cognitively demanding.</p>

    <p>Task switching presents additional challenges. Transitioning between activities requires fully deactivating the neural patterns associated with the previous task before engaging new ones. When inhibitory gating is weak or delayed, previous task states remain partially active, creating interference with new task demands. This produces the cognitive inertia characteristic of autism—difficulty disengaging from one activity to begin another, and distress when transitions are imposed externally.</p>

    <p>When too many pathways compete for control simultaneously, the executive system reaches a critical threshold where it can no longer coordinate conflicting signals. This coordination failure extends to predictive processing: multiple semi-autonomous prediction systems remain active without resolution, each generating competing expectations about incoming information. This creates what can be termed predictive interference—the system faces numerous partial mismatches between expectation and reality simultaneously, and each unresolved prediction continues consuming resources as it propagates through distributed circuits.</p>

    <p>The accumulation of unresolved predictions and competing activations creates exponentially increasing metabolic demand. When energy consumption exceeds the brain's capacity to generate ATP and maintain ionic balance, the system reaches energetic collapse. Shutdowns occur when circuits can no longer sustain activity and must cease functioning to allow metabolic recovery. Meltdowns occur when excitatory spread overwhelms multiple systems—emotional, sensory, and motor—simultaneously before shutdown can occur, producing uncontrolled behavioral output followed by collapse. These are not psychological responses but biophysical limits of a high-resolution, high-demand neural architecture operating beyond its metabolic capacity.</p>
