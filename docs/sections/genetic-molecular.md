    <p>Dozens of genes associated with autism converge on synaptic formation, pruning, inhibition, and excitation balance. I interpret these not as separate mechanisms but as contributors to the same distributed architecture. Each modifies the probability that neurons will form, maintain, or suppress collateral connections.</p>

    <p>These genetic influences share a common architectural outcome: a brain that favors distributed activation over selective filtering. The diversity of genetic paths leading to autism therefore reflects convergence on a <strong>connectivity phenotype</strong>, not a single molecular pathway.</p>

  <div id="tab-std" class="tab-panel">
    <p>The genetic landscape of autism encompasses dozens of risk genes that affect different molecular processes—synaptic scaffolding, chromatin remodeling, ion channel function, interneuron migration, and protein synthesis. Rather than viewing these as separate dysfunctions, the Distributed Pathway Model interprets them as convergent contributors to a shared architectural outcome: increased local branching and reduced inhibitory containment.</p>

    <p>Genes such as <em>SHANK3</em> and <em>SYNGAP1</em> regulate excitatory synapse formation, influencing how many connections a neuron maintains and how selectively it prunes them. Chromatin regulators like <em>CHD8</em> and <em>ARID1B</em> control developmental timing, extending the windows during which neurons proliferate and differentiate—effectively delaying or weakening pruning. Genes affecting interneuron migration (<em>POGZ</em>, <em>SCN2A</em>) disrupt the spatial and temporal deployment of inhibitory control, allowing excitatory signals to propagate more broadly. Ion channel genes (<em>CACNA1C</em>, <em>GRIN2B</em>) alter the threshold and timing of neuronal firing, affecting how oscillations synchronize across regions.</p>

    <p>Despite their molecular diversity, these genetic variants produce overlapping circuit-level effects: locally denser connectivity, weaker inhibitory gating, and broader signal propagation. This convergence suggests that autism's genetic heterogeneity reflects multiple routes to the same topological outcome—a <strong>connectivity phenotype</strong> characterized by distributed branching rather than a single broken pathway. Understanding this convergence shifts the focus from cataloging individual gene defects to modeling how diverse molecular alterations reshape network architecture in functionally similar ways.</p>

  <div id="tab-gen" class="tab-panel">
    <p>Autism is linked to changes in dozens of different genes, each affecting how the brain develops. Some of these genes control how neurons form connections during early development. Others regulate when and how aggressively the brain prunes away extra connections—a process that normally streamlines neural circuits. Still others affect inhibitory neurons, which act as the brain's control system to prevent signals from spreading too widely.</p>

    <p>What researchers have found is that despite affecting different molecular processes, many autism-related genes produce similar outcomes at the circuit level: more local connections between neurons, weaker inhibitory control, and a greater tendency for signals to propagate through multiple pathways instead of following a single route. This pattern suggests that autism isn't caused by one specific broken mechanism, but rather by multiple genetic changes that all shift brain architecture in the same direction—toward distributed, higher-resolution processing.</p>

    <p>This convergence helps explain why autism can result from so many different genetic variants yet still produce recognizable patterns of perception, cognition, and behavior. The genes differ, but they collectively produce a brain that processes information with greater local detail and reduced top-down filtering, leading to both the strengths and challenges characteristic of autism.</p>
