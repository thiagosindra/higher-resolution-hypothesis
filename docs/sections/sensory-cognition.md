    <p>Distributed branching reshapes both sensory encoding and cognitive processing: wider microcircuit recruitment increases discrimination precision and cross-modal binding while reducing selectivity and raising overload thresholds.</p>

  <div id="tab-std" class="tab-panel">
    <p>When distributed pathways engage more neurons per sensory input, the autistic brain samples stimuli at higher resolution—detecting subtle color gradients, pitch variations, or background textures that others filter out. This heightened sensory acuity reflects increased activation in primary sensory cortices (confirmed by fMRI and MEG). Distributed propagation can also blur modality boundaries, producing cross-sensory associations (e.g., sound evoking color) through overlapping microcircuits. However, broader recruitment reduces selectivity: irrelevant or repetitive stimuli continue propagating through distributed branches long after their salience has passed, yielding subjective overload and difficulty filtering background noise.</p>

    <p>Cognitively, distributed propagation transforms reasoning into a multi-threaded process. A single conceptual input activates multiple associative pathways in parallel, enabling deep pattern recognition and original insights but increasing decision time and working memory load. Predictive coding frameworks describe this as higher precision-weighting of sensory data over priors: more microcircuits represent raw input, fewer remain for abstract filtering. When weak inhibition fails to suppress competing activations, the system remains in superposition—experienced as decision paralysis or prolonged indecision. Emotional responses similarly amplify through distributed limbic-prefrontal spread, contributing to intensity and persistence of affective states.</p>

    <p>Imagine turning up the brain's "resolution" dial: suddenly you notice the hum of fluorescent lights, individual threads in fabric, or micro-expressions others miss. That's the sensory side of distributed processing—your brain samples more detail from the same input. It can also blend senses together: a sound might evoke a color, or a texture might trigger a taste memory. But this richness comes with a cost: your brain doesn't easily tune out irrelevant details. Background chatter keeps activating circuits long after it should fade, creating the sensation of "too much at once." In thinking, this means you consider multiple angles simultaneously—great for spotting patterns and making connections, but it can slow decisions because you're weighing more possibilities. Emotions feel more intense too, because the same distributed circuits amplify their signal across more brain regions. Higher resolution means both sharper insights and heavier processing loads.</p>
