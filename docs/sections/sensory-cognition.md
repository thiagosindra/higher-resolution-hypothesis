    <p>Distributed branching reshapes both sensory encoding and cognitive processing: wider microcircuit recruitment increases discrimination precision and cross-modal binding while reducing selectivity and raising overload thresholds.</p>

  <div id="tab-std" class="tab-panel">
    <p>When distributed pathways engage more neurons per sensory input, the autistic brain samples stimuli at higher resolution—detecting subtle color gradients, pitch variations, or background textures that others filter out. This heightened sensory acuity reflects increased activation in primary sensory cortices (confirmed by fMRI and MEG). Distributed propagation can also blur modality boundaries, producing cross-sensory associations (e.g., sound evoking color) through overlapping microcircuits. However, broader recruitment reduces selectivity: irrelevant or repetitive stimuli continue propagating through distributed branches long after their salience has passed, yielding subjective overload and difficulty filtering background noise.</p>

    <p>Cognitively, distributed propagation transforms reasoning into a multi-threaded process. A single conceptual input activates multiple associative pathways in parallel, enabling deep pattern recognition and original insights but increasing decision time and working memory load. Predictive coding frameworks describe this as higher precision-weighting of sensory data over priors: more microcircuits represent raw input, fewer remain for abstract filtering. When weak inhibition fails to suppress competing activations, the system remains in superposition—experienced as decision paralysis or prolonged indecision. Emotional responses similarly amplify through distributed limbic-prefrontal spread, contributing to intensity and persistence of affective states.</p>

  <div id="tab-gen" class="tab-panel">
    <p>The sensory effects of distributed neural architecture can be understood as processing input at higher resolution. Autistic individuals commonly report noticing details that others filter out automatically—the hum of fluorescent lights, subtle texture variations, minor pitch changes, or fleeting micro-expressions. This heightened sensitivity reflects the recruitment of more neurons in sensory processing regions, effectively sampling the environment with greater precision.</p>

    <p>In some cases, this distributed processing can create cross-sensory associations, where stimulation in one modality (such as sound) produces perceptual experiences in another (such as color). This occurs when signals propagate across partially overlapping circuits that typically remain more segregated in neurotypical brains.</p>

    <p>The trade-off is reduced selectivity. Because more neural pathways respond to and maintain activity from each stimulus, the brain has difficulty filtering irrelevant or repetitive information. Background sounds or ambient sensory input continue engaging circuits longer than necessary, producing subjective overload and difficulty concentrating in complex sensory environments.</p>

    <p>Cognitively, this architecture affects reasoning and decision-making. Processing a single concept or problem activates multiple associative pathways concurrently, enabling sophisticated pattern recognition and novel insights. However, this parallel activation also increases the time and mental effort required to reach decisions, as more possibilities must be evaluated. Emotional experiences are similarly amplified, as affective signals propagate through broader limbic and prefrontal networks, producing greater intensity and longer persistence of emotional states.</p>
