    <p>The Distributed Pathway Model reframes intervention from normalization toward regulation and adaptation: target temporal gating and inhibitory precision rather than reducing connectivity; support energy recovery through rhythmic entrainment and predictability; and harness deep-focus loops as self-stabilizing mechanisms.</p>

  <div id="tab-std" class="tab-panel">
    <p>Understanding autism's challenges and strengths as expressions of the same distributed architecture reframes clinical and educational practice. <strong>Clinical context:</strong> Meltdowns, shutdowns, and stimming are regulatory responses within a distributed system, not behavioral anomalies. Interventions should support energy recovery and inhibitory precision—rest cycles, rhythmic activities (music, movement, patterned sensory input), structured predictability—rather than suppress expressive behaviors. Therapeutic approaches targeting temporal gating (inhibitory timing) show more promise than blunt connectivity reduction. <strong>Sensory environment design:</strong> Because distributed systems over-sample input, spaces should minimize unpredictable multimodal noise. Provide monotonic or user-controllable stimuli that reduce branching load: dimmable lighting, sound damping, predictable transitions.</p>

    <p><strong>Education and work:</strong> Deep-focus and special-interest engagement form self-stabilizing loops where prediction error is minimal. Curricula and workplaces permitting autonomy and prolonged focus exploit the system's strengths rather than fight its cognitive inertia. Task segmentation should externalize micro-steps to reduce hidden branching. <strong>Therapeutic framing:</strong> Therapies emphasizing interoceptive awareness, pacing (energy budget management), and predictable sequencing may enhance self-regulation more effectively than purely behavioral approaches. These implications extend beyond autism to broader neurodiversity models: understanding distributed versus streamlined processing informs approaches to attention, creativity, and resilience across all brain architectures.</p>

  <div id="tab-gen" class="tab-panel">
    <p>If autism reflects a different wiring pattern rather than broken circuitry, support should work <em>with</em> that architecture, not against it. <strong>Clinical:</strong> When someone melts down or shuts down, they're not being difficult—they've hit a metabolic wall. Recovery needs rest, not more demands. Stimming isn't something to suppress; it's the brain's natural way of re-stabilizing through rhythm. <strong>Environment:</strong> Reduce unpredictable sensory chaos—fluorescent flicker, overlapping conversations, sudden transitions. Offer control: dimmers, noise cancellation, clear schedules. The brain can handle complexity when it's <em>chosen</em>, not when it's forced.</p>

    <p><strong>Work and school:</strong> Let people go deep. When you can dive into a focused interest without constant interruption, the brain builds stable loops where everything clicks. That mastery is both rewarding and regulating. Breaking tasks into explicit micro-steps reduces the hidden branching that causes anticipation paralysis. <strong>Therapy:</strong> Teaching someone to notice their internal energy budget and pace themselves beats trying to train them to "act normal." Understanding how your own system works—when it's nearing overload, what restores coherence—turns abstract struggle into manageable self-knowledge. The goal isn't to make autistic brains neurotypical; it's to let them operate at their best resolution without running out of fuel.</p>
