    <p>Social interaction demands rapid prediction across sensory, linguistic, and emotional channels. In a Distributed Pathway architecture, each cue—tone, word choice, posture, microexpression—spawns its own cascade of interpretations. The autistic brain doesn't miss social signals; it <strong>processes too many</strong> at once, with reduced gating to suppress the irrelevant.</p>

    <h3>Masking as Adaptive Compression</h3>
    <p>Because neurotypical communication relies on compressed heuristics—shared shorthand, emotional inference—the autistic individual often learns to "mask" by simulating this compression. Masking is not deception but <strong>adaptive compression</strong>: suppressing distributed authenticity to reduce social friction. It is metabolically expensive and cognitively draining, as it requires active gating against the brain's natural branching.</p>

    <h3>Evaluation Misalignment and Anxiety Loops</h3>
    <p>During interaction, I evaluate what I said, what I meant, how it was received, and what others might infer from it—all nearly simultaneously. This <strong>multi-layered evaluation loop</strong> is a direct outcome of distributed propagation: self and other representations co-activate, recursively analyzing one another. When the loop doesn't converge quickly, uncertainty persists as social anxiety. The anxiety is not fear of people but the discomfort of an unresolved feedback system.</p>

    <h3>Empathy and Resonance</h3>
    <p>Far from lacking empathy, distributed propagation enhances it. Emotional states can activate broad associative maps, making another's distress or excitement almost physically contagious. Without well-timed inhibition, this resonance becomes overwhelming, explaining the oscillation between deep compassion and withdrawal.</p>

    <p>In essence, social difficulties in autism reflect <strong>processing asymmetry, not absence</strong>: two differently organized networks trying to synchronize their prediction systems.</p>

  <div id="tab-std" class="tab-panel">
    <p>Social communication requires integrating multiple simultaneous signals—verbal content, tone, facial expressions, body language, contextual cues—and generating rapid predictions about others' intentions and emotional states. In the Distributed Pathway Model, each of these cues activates multiple interpretive pathways rather than converging on a single inference. The autistic brain processes a broader array of social signals concurrently, but with reduced inhibitory gating to filter out less relevant interpretations.</p>

    <p>This creates what appears externally as social difficulty but internally reflects information overload rather than signal blindness. Multiple possible meanings remain active simultaneously, making it harder to commit to a single interpretation or response. The system is not failing to detect social cues—it is detecting and processing too many potential readings of the same interaction, generating uncertainty where neurotypical cognition would have already compressed the signal into a high-confidence inference.</p>

    <p><strong>Masking</strong> emerges as an adaptive response to this mismatch. Neurotypical communication relies on shared heuristics and compressed shortcuts—implicit emotional inferences, conventional phrasing, expected timing. Autistic individuals often learn to simulate these compressions by actively suppressing their distributed processing and adopting neurotypical communication patterns. This is metabolically expensive because it requires sustained inhibition against the brain's natural branching tendency, explaining why masking leads to exhaustion and eventual burnout.</p>

    <p>Social interactions also trigger recursive evaluation loops. During conversation, autistic individuals may simultaneously track what they intended to say, what they actually said, how it was likely received, and what alternative interpretations the other person might construct. These parallel evaluations co-activate and analyze one another, creating multi-layered feedback systems. When these loops fail to converge quickly, the result is persistent uncertainty—experienced as social anxiety. The anxiety is not interpersonal fear but the cognitive discomfort of an unresolved predictive system.</p>

    <p>Contrary to deficit models of empathy, distributed propagation can amplify emotional resonance. Observing another person's emotional state activates broad associative networks, making their distress or joy almost physically contagious. When inhibition is too weak to modulate this resonance, the intensity becomes overwhelming, prompting withdrawal. Autistic social challenges thus reflect <strong>processing asymmetry</strong>—two differently organized prediction systems attempting to synchronize—rather than an absence of social motivation or emotional understanding.</p>

  <div id="tab-gen" class="tab-panel">
    <p>Social interaction involves tracking many signals at once: what someone is saying, how they're saying it, their facial expressions, body language, and the broader context of the conversation. For autistic individuals operating with distributed neural pathways, each of these cues can trigger multiple possible interpretations rather than quickly converging on a single meaning. The challenge is not missing social signals but processing too many potential readings simultaneously without an efficient way to filter out the less relevant ones.</p>

    <p>This can make social situations feel overwhelming and uncertain. While others might quickly settle on "they seem happy" or "they're being sarcastic," the autistic brain may continue holding multiple competing interpretations active at once, making it harder to settle on a response. What looks like social difficulty from the outside often reflects information overload internally—too much social data being processed in too much detail, rather than too little.</p>

    <p><strong>Masking</strong>—adopting neurotypical communication patterns and suppressing natural responses—is a common adaptation to this mismatch. Neurotypical communication relies on shortcuts and implicit understandings that distributed processing doesn't naturally produce. Learning to simulate these compressions requires actively suppressing the brain's tendency to branch into multiple analyses, which is mentally exhausting. This explains why masking leads to fatigue and burnout: it demands sustained effort to override the brain's default processing mode.</p>

    <p>Social interactions can also trigger recursive loops of evaluation. You might simultaneously track what you meant to say, what you actually said, how the other person likely interpreted it, and what alternative meanings they might have constructed. These parallel analyses feed back into each other, and when they don't quickly resolve, the result is lingering uncertainty—often experienced as social anxiety. The anxiety comes not from fear of people but from the cognitive tension of an unresolved prediction about how the interaction went.</p>

    <p>Regarding empathy, distributed processing can actually amplify emotional resonance. Observing someone else's emotional state can activate broad networks in your own brain, making their feelings almost physically contagious. When this resonance isn't well-regulated, it can become overwhelming, leading to withdrawal. Autistic social challenges often stem from this intensity and from the mismatch between different processing architectures, not from a lack of emotional understanding or social motivation.</p>
