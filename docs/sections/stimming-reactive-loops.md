    <p>Stimming originates as a reactive motor cascade—distributed propagation overflowing into motor regions—that secondarily entrains sensory and interoceptive circuits into stabilizing feedback loops, reducing systemic entropy through rhythmic coherence.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="tab-std" class="tab-panel">
    <p>Within the Distributed Pathway Model, stimming arises when concurrent activation in sensory, emotional, and cognitive circuits exceeds inhibitory containment, spilling into motor regions through weakly gated branches. This reactive cascade produces spontaneous, patterned movement—not as a deliberate coping strategy but as the brain's intrinsic route for offloading excess activation. Once initiated, rhythmic repetition creates a stabilizing feedback loop: each cycle of motion re-entrains related sensory and interoceptive circuits, synchronizing distributed oscillations and lowering systemic entropy. The movement restores temporal coherence by converting diffuse excitation into periodic, predictable activity.</p>

    <p>Reactive pathways more broadly can also produce structured internal outputs. When distributed propagation forms closed feedback loops across auditory, motor-simulation, and associative regions, the result may be autonomous oscillators—persistent internal music, recursive thought patterns, or spontaneous problem-solving that continues "in the background." These loops reflect the network finding stable dynamic equilibria within its own structure. Whether a reactive loop produces creative insight, involuntary replay, or intrusive perseveration depends on its stability depth and gating. Suppressing stimming interrupts a natural stabilization route within a high-resolution, cascade-prone neural system.</p>

  <div id="tab-gen" class="tab-panel">
    <p>When the brain juggles too many signals at once, the overflow can "leak" into the motor system, producing spontaneous repetitive movement—hand-flapping, rocking, pacing. This isn't a conscious choice but the system finding an outlet for accumulated energy. Once started, the rhythm itself helps: each cycle creates a predictable beat that other brain regions can sync to, like a metronome calming scattered musicians. The same principle applies internally—melodies that loop in your head, thoughts that keep circling back. These are "reactive pathways" reaching stable patterns on their own. Whether that stability produces useful creativity or unwanted intrusion depends on the loop's structure. Stimming, in this view, is the body's way of re-tuning a high-resolution system that's momentarily out of sync.</p>
