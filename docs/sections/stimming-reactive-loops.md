    <h2>Stimming and Reactive Motor Loops</h2>

    <p>Stimming—self-stimulatory repetitive movements such as hand-flapping, rocking, finger-tapping, pacing, or object manipulation—has historically been framed as maladaptive behavior requiring suppression. The Distributed Pathway Model offers a mechanistic alternative: stimming originates as a reactive motor cascade when distributed activation exceeds inhibitory containment and spills into motor regions. In this framework, stimming is modeled as reactive output—an involuntary consequence of distributed propagation—rather than as an instrument of regulation.</p>

    <h3>Reactive Motor Cascade</h3>

    <p>In distributed architecture, concurrent activation across sensory, emotional, and cognitive circuits can exceed the capacity of inhibitory systems to contain it. When activation propagates through weakly gated branches connecting associative and emotional circuits to premotor and motor cortex, the overflow manifests as spontaneous, patterned movement. This is not volitional motor planning—it is reactive propagation finding the path of least resistance when internal gating fails to suppress spread.</p>

    <p>The movements produced through this cascade are characteristically rhythmic and repetitive because motor circuits naturally form oscillatory patterns when driven by sustained input. Once initiated, these patterns persist through recurrent motor-sensory feedback loops: the movement generates proprioceptive and tactile feedback, which reactivates motor pathways, sustaining the cycle. This is neurally analogous to central pattern generators observed in locomotion and other rhythmic motor behaviors, but driven by overflow from cognitive-emotional load rather than locomotor intent.</p>

    <p>Empirical support includes neuroimaging evidence of heightened motor cortex excitability in autism and EEG studies showing altered sensorimotor oscillations. Stimming frequency and intensity correlate with measures of cognitive load, arousal, and sensory overload, consistent with the hypothesis that stimming serves as an outlet for distributed activation that cannot be internally gated.</p>

    <h3>Suppression Costs and Phenomenological Effects</h3>

    <p>Some individuals report that stimming feels subjectively calming or helps restore focus. However, these reports are phenomenological—subjective experiences that may co-occur with stimming—and mechanistic regulation is out of scope in this model. The DPM does not model stimming as producing stabilization or entrainment effects; rather, stimming emerges when distributed activity spills into motor circuits (reactive cascade).</p>

    <p>What the model does predict is that forcibly suppressing reactive motor cascades imposes significant costs. Top-down suppression of emergent movement recruits additional control networks (prefrontal cortex) and inhibitory drive (amygdala-mediated suppression under social threat), raising local energy demand and potentially destabilizing processing. When cascades are suppressed, activation that would have manifested as movement remains distributed across internal circuits, compounding inhibitory and energetic load (see <a href="../intro/4-dual-constraints">Dual-Constraint section</a> and <a href="energetic-collapse">Energetic Constraints</a>).</p>

    <p>This explains why forced suppression of stimming often increases distress rather than reducing it: the system recruits costly control mechanisms while retaining the distributed activation that triggered the cascade in the first place. The energetic and inhibitory costs of suppression may worsen dysregulation by engaging additional networks under already-high load conditions.</p>

    <h3>Complex Outputs from Reactive Pathways</h3>

    <p>Reactive pathways are not limited to motor output. When distributed propagation forms closed loops across auditory imagery, motor simulation, and associative regions, the result can be autonomous oscillators—persistent internal experiences that run without volitional control. These include involuntary music loops (earworms that persist for hours or days), recursive thought patterns, spontaneous problem-solving that continues "in the background," and intrusive conceptual loops.</p>

    <p>These phenomena reflect the network finding stable dynamic equilibria within its own topology. When activation propagating through distributed branches encounters a configuration that feeds back onto itself—where output from one circuit becomes input to another, which then reactivates the first—a self-sustaining loop forms. Whether this loop produces creative insight, autonomous problem-solving, or intrusive perseveration depends on its stability characteristics, informational content, and degree of inhibitory modulation.</p>

    <p>In favorable cases, these loops support exceptional abilities: mental music composition, mathematical problem-solving that occurs autonomously, creative pattern recognition emerging from persistent background processing. The same mechanism that produces intrusive loops can generate genuine insight when the loop engages content-rich associative pathways and remains open to external modulation. Conversely, when loops become rigid or engage circuits with high negative valence, they manifest as rumination, obsessive thought patterns, or perseveration.</p>

    <h3>Functional Role in Distributed Architecture</h3>

    <p>Stimming and reactive loops should be understood as intrinsic features of distributed architecture under load, not as dysfunctions to be eliminated. When distributed activation exceeds inhibitory containment, reactive cascades emerge through the path of least resistance—often motor circuits. Suppressing these cascades without addressing the underlying distributed activation forces the system to manage overload through pathways more likely to lead to collapse: sustained executive suppression (metabolically expensive and recruiting PFC control networks), amygdala-mediated fear/suppression (when social threat drives inhibition of natural output), or shutdown (when no outlet remains and energy reserves deplete).</p>

    <p>Understanding stimming as reactive motor cascade—rather than as a regulatory mechanism—reframes intervention. The goal is not suppression but accommodation: recognizing that stimming is a consequence of distributed propagation under load, providing environments where it can occur without social penalty, and reducing the sources of overload (sensory input, concurrent demands, prediction errors) that trigger cascades in the first place. Suppression increases costs without addressing causes.</p>

    <h2>How Stimming Emerges as Reactive Cascade</h2>

    <p>Stimming—repetitive self-stimulatory movements like hand-flapping, rocking, or pacing—emerges through a specific mechanism in distributed architecture. In this framework, stimming is treated as a reactive motor cascade—an involuntary output of distributed propagation—rather than a regulatory mechanism.</p>

    <h3>Reactive Motor Cascade: Overflow Into Movement</h3>

    <p>Within the Distributed Pathway Model, stimming arises when concurrent activation across sensory, emotional, and cognitive circuits exceeds the capacity of inhibitory systems to contain it. This excess activation propagates through weakly gated branches connecting associative and emotional circuits to motor regions, producing spontaneous patterned movement. This isn't deliberate coping behavior—it's the brain's intrinsic response when internal activation exceeds containment capacity and finds an outlet through motor pathways.</p>

    <p>The movements are characteristically rhythmic and repetitive because motor circuits naturally form oscillatory patterns when driven by sustained input. Once initiated, these patterns persist through motor-sensory feedback loops: movement generates proprioceptive and tactile feedback, which reactivates motor pathways, sustaining the cycle. This is similar to central pattern generators in locomotion, but driven by overflow from cognitive-emotional load rather than locomotor intent.</p>

    <p>Research shows stimming frequency and intensity correlate with measures of cognitive load, arousal, and sensory overload, consistent with stimming serving as an outlet for distributed activation that cannot be internally gated.</p>

    <h3>Suppression Costs and Subjective Experience</h3>

    <p>Some individuals report that stimming feels subjectively calming, helps restore focus, or reduces sensory overload. These phenomenological reports are valid experiences but fall outside the scope of the mechanistic model. Mechanistic regulation is not modeled here; stimming emerges when distributed activity spills into motor circuits (reactive cascade).</p>

    <p>What the model does predict is that forcibly suppressing reactive motor cascades recruits additional control networks and inhibitory drive, raising energetic load. Top-down suppression (PFC-driven control) and amygdala-mediated suppression under social threat both increase metabolic demand and potentially worsen dysregulation by recruiting more networks and energy while leaving the underlying distributed activation unaddressed (see <a href="../intro/4-dual-constraints">Dual-Constraint section</a> and <a href="energetic-collapse">Energetic Constraints</a>).</p>

    <p>This explains why forced suppression of stimming often increases distress: the system recruits costly control mechanisms while retaining the distributed activation that triggered the cascade. Suppression imposes energetic and inhibitory costs that may compound existing overload.</p>

    <h3>Internal Reactive Loops</h3>

    <p>Reactive pathways aren't limited to motor output. When distributed propagation forms closed loops across auditory imagery, motor simulation, and associative regions, the result can be autonomous oscillators—persistent internal experiences running without volitional control. These include involuntary music loops persisting for hours or days, recursive thought patterns, spontaneous problem-solving continuing "in the background," and intrusive conceptual loops.</p>

    <p>These reflect the network finding stable dynamic equilibria within its own topology. When activation propagates through distributed branches and encounters a configuration that feeds back onto itself, a self-sustaining loop forms. Whether this produces creative insight, autonomous problem-solving, or intrusive perseveration depends on its stability characteristics, informational content, and degree of inhibitory modulation.</p>

    <p>In favorable cases, these loops support exceptional abilities: mental music composition, mathematical problem-solving occurring autonomously, creative pattern recognition emerging from persistent background processing. The same mechanism that produces intrusive loops can generate genuine insight when engaging content-rich associative pathways that remain open to external modulation. Conversely, rigid loops engaging circuits with negative valence manifest as rumination, obsessive patterns, or perseveration.</p>

    <h3>Accommodation, Not Suppression</h3>

    <p>Stimming and reactive loops are intrinsic features of distributed architecture under load, not dysfunctions to eliminate. When distributed activation exceeds inhibitory containment, reactive cascades emerge through the path of least resistance—often motor circuits. Suppressing these cascades without addressing underlying activation forces the system to manage overload through pathways more likely to lead to collapse: sustained executive suppression (metabolically expensive, recruiting PFC control), amygdala-mediated suppression (when social threat drives inhibition), or shutdown (when no outlet remains).</p>

    <p>Understanding stimming as reactive motor cascade—not as a regulatory mechanism—reframes intervention. The goal is accommodation: recognizing that stimming is a consequence of distributed propagation under load, providing environments where it can occur without social penalty, and reducing the sources of overload (sensory input, concurrent demands, prediction errors) that trigger cascades. Suppression increases costs without addressing causes.</p>

    <h2>Why Stimming Happens</h2>

    <p>Stimming—repetitive movements like hand-flapping, rocking, finger-tapping, pacing, or fidgeting with objects—is one of the most visible features of autism. It's often viewed as something that needs to be stopped or hidden, but understanding why it happens reveals that stimming is a natural consequence of how the autistic brain processes information under load.</p>

    <h3>When the Brain Overflows Into Movement</h3>

    <p>Imagine a busy highway system where traffic is flowing through many interconnected routes. When traffic volume exceeds the system's capacity, cars start overflowing onto side roads, alternate routes, and eventually any available path. The overflow isn't intentional—it's just where traffic naturally goes when the main routes can't contain it all.</p>

    <p>Stimming works similarly. When your brain is processing a lot of sensory input, emotions, or thoughts simultaneously, all those neural signals create activation that spreads through many pathways. When this activation exceeds what your brain's "gating" systems can contain, it overflows into motor regions—the parts controlling movement. The result is spontaneous, repetitive motion.</p>

    <p>This explains why stimming increases when:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>You're overwhelmed:</strong> More sensory input or emotional intensity means more neural activation seeking outlets</li>
      <li><strong>You're excited:</strong> Positive emotions create activation that also needs somewhere to go</li>
      <li><strong>You're concentrating hard:</strong> Intense cognitive effort fills neural pathways, and movement provides an outlet</li>
      <li><strong>You're anxious or uncertain:</strong> Emotional distress creates sustained activation without clear resolution</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The movements aren't consciously chosen—they emerge naturally when your brain has more activation than it can internally manage. This is why trying to consciously stop stimming feels effortful and why it often returns as soon as attention shifts elsewhere.</p>

    <h3>Why Some People Feel Calmer When Stimming</h3>

    <p>Many people report that stimming feels calming, helps them focus, or makes overwhelming situations more manageable. These are real, valid experiences. However, from the model's perspective, these are phenomenological—things people experience and feel—rather than mechanistic functions the model explains.</p>

    <p>What the model does explain is what happens when stimming is suppressed:</p>

    <p><strong>When stimming is allowed:</strong> The overflow of activation finds an outlet through movement. The brain isn't trying to manage that activation internally anymore—it's expressing it.</p>

    <p><strong>When stimming is suppressed:</strong> That same activation is still there, but now you have to actively work to keep it from becoming movement. This requires:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>More brain resources:</strong> Your prefrontal cortex (control center) has to constantly monitor and suppress the movement urge</li>
      <li><strong>More energy:</strong> Suppression burns additional metabolic fuel on top of the already-high processing load</li>
      <li><strong>More stress:</strong> When suppression is driven by social fear ("I'll be judged if I stim"), your amygdala activates, adding emotional load</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This is why being told "stop doing that" feels immediately distressing, why forced suppression often increases anxiety, and why people often stim more intensely after being prevented from stimming—the activation builds up with nowhere to go, and suppressing it adds costs rather than solving the underlying overflow.</p>

    <h3>Songs Stuck in Your Head and Thought Loops</h3>

    <p>The same mechanism that creates stimming can also create internal loops—patterns that run in your mind without conscious control:</p>

    <p><strong>Music loops:</strong> A song gets "stuck in your head" and plays repeatedly for hours or days. This happens when neural patterns for that music form a feedback loop—hearing it in your imagination reactivates the pathways that generate it, which makes you "hear" it again, which reactivates the pathways, and so on.</p>

    <p><strong>Thought loops:</strong> A particular thought pattern, problem, or conversation replay keeps running. You might mentally rehearse a conversation repeatedly, work on a problem in the background of your mind for days, or find certain ideas circling continuously.</p>

    <p><strong>Problem-solving that continues on its own:</strong> You think about a complex problem, then move on to other activities—but hours later, a solution suddenly appears. Your brain was still processing it in the background through sustained neural loops.</p>

    <p>Whether these loops are helpful or distressing depends on their content and stability:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Helpful loops:</strong> Working through creative problems, composing music mentally, developing complex ideas, recognizing patterns</li>
      <li><strong>Distressing loops:</strong> Ruminating on negative events, intrusive worries that won't resolve, obsessive thoughts, replaying mistakes</li>
    </ul>

    <p>These aren't separate from stimming—they're the same mechanism (sustained feedback loops) happening internally instead of through movement.</p>

    <h3>Why Stopping Stimming Makes Things Worse</h3>

    <p>When autistic people are told to "stop stimming," "sit still," or "keep your hands quiet," it forces the brain to suppress a natural reactive output. This suppression itself has costs, and the underlying activation that triggered the cascade remains. Combined, this means:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Internal distress increases:</strong> The activation that would have overflowed into movement is still there, plus you're now spending resources suppressing the urge to move</li>
      <li><strong>Focus becomes harder:</strong> You're now allocating attention and control resources to movement suppression instead of the task at hand</li>
      <li><strong>Overload happens faster:</strong> The brain reaches its limits sooner because suppression adds costs (PFC control, amygdala activation under social threat) on top of existing load</li>
      <li><strong>Shutdown or meltdown becomes more likely:</strong> The combined energetic and inhibitory costs of suppression plus retained activation accelerate collapse</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This is why many autistic adults report that being allowed to stim freely dramatically improves their functioning. It's not that stimming itself accomplishes tasks—it's that not suppressing stimming avoids the additional costs (control networks, energy, stress) that make overload worse and tasks impossible.</p>

    <h3>The Core Understanding</h3>

    <p>Stimming is not:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A bad habit to break</li>
      <li>Purposeless behavior</li>
      <li>Something to be ashamed of</li>
      <li>A sign of lack of control</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Stimming is:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The brain's natural response to activation overflow</li>
      <li>A reactive motor cascade—involuntary output when distributed activation exceeds containment</li>
      <li>An outlet for activation that has nowhere else to go</li>
      <li>An intrinsic feature of how distributed architecture responds to high information load</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Understanding this reframes how we think about stimming. Instead of trying to suppress it (which increases distress and cognitive load by recruiting additional control networks and energy), effective support means:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Allowing stimming to happen without social penalty</li>
      <li>Providing environments where stimming is accepted</li>
      <li>Recognizing increased stimming as a sign of high cognitive load (not misbehavior)</li>
      <li>Reducing the sources of overload (sensory input, concurrent demands, unpredictability) that trigger cascades in the first place</li>
    </ul>

    <p>When autistic people feel safe to stim freely, they often function better in every other domain—not because stimming provides regulation, but because they're not burning additional resources suppressing natural reactive outputs while simultaneously managing the overload that triggered them.</p>
