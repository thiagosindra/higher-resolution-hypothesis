    <p>Stimming originates as a reactive motor cascade—distributed propagation overflowing into motor regions—that secondarily entrains sensory and interoceptive circuits into stabilizing feedback loops, reducing systemic entropy through rhythmic coherence.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="tab-std" class="tab-panel">
    <p>Within the Distributed Pathway Model, stimming arises when concurrent activation in sensory, emotional, and cognitive circuits exceeds inhibitory containment, spilling into motor regions through weakly gated branches. This reactive cascade produces spontaneous, patterned movement—not as a deliberate coping strategy but as the brain's intrinsic route for offloading excess activation. Once initiated, rhythmic repetition creates a stabilizing feedback loop: each cycle of motion re-entrains related sensory and interoceptive circuits, synchronizing distributed oscillations and lowering systemic entropy. The movement restores temporal coherence by converting diffuse excitation into periodic, predictable activity.</p>

    <p>Reactive pathways more broadly can also produce structured internal outputs. When distributed propagation forms closed feedback loops across auditory, motor-simulation, and associative regions, the result may be autonomous oscillators—persistent internal music, recursive thought patterns, or spontaneous problem-solving that continues "in the background." These loops reflect the network finding stable dynamic equilibria within its own structure. Whether a reactive loop produces creative insight, involuntary replay, or intrusive perseveration depends on its stability depth and gating. Suppressing stimming interrupts a natural stabilization route within a high-resolution, cascade-prone neural system.</p>

  <div id="tab-gen" class="tab-panel">
    <p>Stimming—repetitive self-stimulatory movements such as hand-flapping, rocking, or pacing—arises through a specific mechanism within distributed neural architecture. When concurrent activation across sensory, emotional, and cognitive circuits exceeds the capacity of inhibitory systems to contain it, this excess activity can propagate into motor regions through weakly gated connections. The resulting movements are not consciously initiated but represent the brain's intrinsic response to accumulated neural activation that lacks other outlets.</p>

    <p>Once these movements begin, they serve a secondary regulatory function. Rhythmic, repetitive motion creates predictable patterns of sensory and motor feedback that help synchronize distributed neural activity. This rhythmic entrainment reduces the temporal variability and interference that characterize overload states, effectively stabilizing the system through predictable oscillation.</p>

    <p>Similar mechanisms operate internally, producing phenomena such as persistent internal music, recurring thought patterns, or spontaneous problem-solving that continues without conscious direction. These reflect closed feedback loops within distributed circuits—patterns of activity that become self-sustaining. Whether such loops produce creative insights or intrusive repetition depends on their stability characteristics and how well they can be modulated by inhibitory control.</p>

    <p>Suppressing stimming interrupts this natural stabilization process, forcing a high-resolution system experiencing overload to maintain coherence without access to one of its primary regulatory mechanisms. Understanding stimming as reactive motor cascade rather than purposeless behavior reframes it as a structural feature of how distributed neural architecture maintains equilibrium under strain.</p>
