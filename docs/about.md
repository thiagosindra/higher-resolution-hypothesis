# About The Higher-Resolution Hypothesis: A Distributed Pathway Model of Autism

**Author:** Thiago Sindra, Independent Researcher

This framework represents an open theoretical model intended to invite interdisciplinary critique, empirical testing, and collaborative refinement. The Higher-Resolution Hypothesis emerged from integrating lived experience with systems neuroscience, seeking to explain autistic cognition not as a collection of deficits but as an alternative neural architecture with measurable topological and metabolic properties. The scope spans genetics (synaptic scaffolding, ongoing collateral formation, pruning, inhibition) through circuits (local branching, distributed propagation) to cognition (higher-resolution perception, predictive processing) and lived experience (sensory richness, energetic collapse, regulatory strategies).

This is not a formal publication in a peer-reviewed venue. It is an evolving hypothesis offered as a starting point for scientific dialogue. The framework is designed to be testable through neuroimaging, electrophysiology, organoid models, and behavioral prediction. If you find errors, contradictions, or opportunities for empirical validation, I encourage you to engage critically.

## About the Author

I’m **Thiago Sindra**, a software engineer in California who enjoys turning ideas into systems. Over time, curiosity pulled me toward cognitive neuroscience, and I started comparing my own thinking and behavior with what research predicts—where they align, and where they clearly don’t.

In addition to my engineering work, I once hosted a podcast called **What am I? – Challenge your perception of reality.**, where I invited guests to explore neuroscience, perception and how our inner mental lives shape what we call "real."

Professionally, much of my work has involved **designing and operating distributed systems and large-scale networks**. That habit of thinking in architectures and trade-offs naturally informs how I frame the **Higher-Resolution Hypothesis**—as a distributed organization of the brain where branching, gating, and energy budgets shape what we perceive and how we think.
