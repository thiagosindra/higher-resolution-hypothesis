# About the Higher-Resolution Hypothesis

**Author:** Thiago Sindra, Independent Researcher

This framework represents an open theoretical model intended to invite interdisciplinary critique, empirical testing, and collaborative refinement. The Higher-Resolution Hypothesis emerged from integrating lived experience with systems neuroscience, seeking to explain autistic cognition not as a collection of deficits but as an alternative neural architecture with measurable topological and metabolic properties. The scope spans genetics (synaptic scaffolding, pruning, inhibition) through circuits (local branching, distributed propagation) to cognition (higher-resolution perception, predictive processing) and lived experience (sensory richness, energetic collapse, regulatory strategies).

This is not a formal publication in a peer-reviewed venue. It is an evolving hypothesis offered as a starting point for scientific dialogue. The framework is designed to be testable through neuroimaging, electrophysiology, organoid models, and behavioral prediction. If you find errors, contradictions, or opportunities for empirical validation, I encourage you to engage critically.

## About the Author

I'm **Thiago Sindra**, a Software Engineer based in California, with years of experience turning ideas into systems. My journey began with a formal engineering background and a fascination for how complex systems—both human and digital—behave under changing conditions. Over time, I became deeply interested in cognitive neuroscience and found myself observing how my own thinking and behavior aligned (or didn't) with what the brain sciences suggest.

In addition to my engineering work, I once hosted a podcast called **What am I? – Challenge your perception of reality.**, where I invited guests to explore neuroscience, perception and how our inner mental lives shape our reality. That experience deepened my introspective habit—coupled with my analytical background in architecture and complexity—and led me to reflect on questions such as: Why do some people process sensory input differently? What happens when internal cognition feels both clearer and more chaotic than we expect?

That mix of technical thinking, introspection, and inquiry into the mechanisms of mind has shaped how I reflect on cognition, complexity, and human experience: with exploration grounded in observation, connection-making and genuine curiosity.
