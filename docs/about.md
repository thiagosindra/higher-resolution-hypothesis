# About the Higher-Resolution Hypothesis

**Author:** Thiago Sindra, Independent Researcher

This framework represents an open theoretical model intended to invite interdisciplinary critique, empirical testing, and collaborative refinement. The Higher-Resolution Hypothesis emerged from integrating lived experience with systems neuroscience, seeking to explain autistic cognition not as a collection of deficits but as an alternative neural architecture with measurable topological and metabolic properties. The scope spans genetics (synaptic scaffolding, pruning, inhibition) through circuits (local branching, distributed propagation) to cognition (higher-resolution perception, predictive processing) and lived experience (sensory richness, energetic collapse, regulatory strategies).

This is not a formal publication in a peer-reviewed venue. It is an evolving hypothesis offered as a starting point for scientific dialogue. The framework is designed to be testable through neuroimaging, electrophysiology, organoid models, and behavioral prediction. If you find errors, contradictions, or opportunities for empirical validation, I encourage you to engage critically.

**Acknowledgment:** This work integrates direct observation of internal cognitive and sensory processes with neuroscientific research. It represents both a personal investigation and a scientific propositionâ€”an attempt to model from within what is typically only measured from without.
