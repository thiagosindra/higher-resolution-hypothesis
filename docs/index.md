# The Higher-Resolution Hypothesis: A Distributed Pathway Model of Autism

## What This Hypothesis Proposes

The **Higher-Resolution Hypothesis (HRH)** offers a unified framework for understanding autism as a distinct mode of neural organization rather than a collection of deficits or dysfunctions. At its core, the hypothesis proposes that autistic cognition arises from a **Distributed Pathway Model (DPM)** of neural connectivity—an architecture characterized by increased local branching, reduced synaptic pruning, and weaker inhibitory gating during development.

This architectural difference produces what can be understood as higher-resolution information processing: the autistic brain engages more neurons per stimulus, encodes finer distinctions within sensory and cognitive domains, and maintains richer representational detail. This yields both exceptional capabilities—pattern detection, sensory acuity, deep expertise, associative thinking—and significant challenges—sensory overload, decision paralysis, energetic exhaustion, and vulnerability to cascade activation.

## Why This Matters

The Distributed Pathway Model provides a mechanistic bridge between:

- **Molecular findings** — dozens of autism-associated genes converging on synaptic formation, pruning, and inhibition
- **Circuit-level observations** — local hyperconnectivity, long-range hypoconnectivity, altered oscillatory dynamics
- **Cognitive phenomenology** — sensory sensitivity, intense interests, executive challenges, social processing differences
- **Energetic phenomena** — shutdowns, meltdowns, and the metabolic cost of high-resolution processing

By explaining how these levels relate through a single topological framework, the hypothesis unifies previously separate theories (E/I imbalance, intense world, predictive coding, weak central coherence) and provides testable predictions about neural structure, function, development, and intervention.

## About this Paper

The Higher-Resolution Hypothesis grew from a convergence of scientific curiosity and lived experience. Over recent years I’ve focused on cognitive neuroscience—asking how subjective experience maps onto neural organization—while closely examining my own patterns through that lens. As I studied neurodivergent and neurotypical cognition, recurring mechanisms emerged that could account for both enhanced sensitivity and overload within one architecture. By connecting findings in synaptic development, excitation/inhibition balance, and predictive processing, a coherent picture took shape: differences in branching, propagation, and inhibitory timing—the Distributed Pathway Model (DPM)—may underlie a wide spectrum of neurocognitive traits.

This is an open theoretical framework, not a definitive conclusion. I’m sharing it to invite interdisciplinary critique, empirical testing, and collaborative refinement. In particular, the framework aims to: (1) integrate disparate results into a mechanistic model, (2) generate testable predictions, (3) inform clinical and educational practice, and (4) offer autistic individuals a scientifically grounded way to understand their own cognition.

My goal is to bridge subjective and biological perspectives and to make the claims specific enough to be substantiated, revised, or refuted by further research.
