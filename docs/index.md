## What This Hypothesis Proposes

The **Higher-Resolution Hypothesis (HRH)** offers a unified framework for understanding autism as a distinct mode of neural organization rather than a collection of deficits or dysfunctions. At its core, the hypothesis proposes that autistic cognition arises from a **Distributed Pathway Model (DPM)** of neural connectivity—an architecture characterized by increased local branching, reduced synaptic pruning, and weaker inhibitory gating during development.

This architectural difference produces what can be understood as higher-resolution information processing: the autistic brain engages more neurons per stimulus, encodes finer distinctions within sensory and cognitive domains, and maintains richer representational detail. This yields both exceptional capabilities—pattern detection, sensory acuity, deep expertise, associative thinking—and significant challenges—sensory overload, decision paralysis, energetic exhaustion, and vulnerability to cascade activation.

## Why This Matters

The Distributed Pathway Model provides a mechanistic bridge between:

- **Molecular findings** — dozens of autism-associated genes converging on synaptic formation, pruning, and inhibition
- **Circuit-level observations** — local hyperconnectivity, long-range hypoconnectivity, altered oscillatory dynamics
- **Cognitive phenomenology** — sensory sensitivity, intense interests, executive challenges, social processing differences
- **Energetic phenomena** — shutdowns, meltdowns, and the metabolic cost of high-resolution processing

By explaining how these levels relate through a single topological framework, the hypothesis unifies previously separate theories (E/I imbalance, intense world, predictive coding, weak central coherence) and provides testable predictions about neural structure, function, development, and intervention.

## About this Paper

The Higher-Resolution Hypothesis emerged from a convergence of scientific curiosity and personal observation. Over the past few years, I have devoted much of my attention to neuroscience—particularly cognitive neuroscience—driven by an enduring interest in how subjective experience maps onto neural organization. Naturally introspective, I have long analyzed my own cognitive patterns and reactions through a neuroscientific lens, comparing them to what is known from research and to the experiences of others. As I deepened my understanding of neurodivergent cognition and how it may differ from neurotypical patterns, I began to notice recurring mechanisms that seemed to explain both enhanced sensitivity and overload within the same framework.

This realization arose not from long-term data collection or laboratory work, but from connecting insights across existing studies, theoretical models, and empirical observations. By aligning known findings in synaptic development, excitation/inhibition balance, and predictive processing with lived cognitive dynamics, a coherent architectural picture began to form: that differences in branching, propagation, and inhibitory timing could account for a wide spectrum of neurocognitive traits. These dots gradually aligned into what I came to call the **Distributed Pathway Model (DPM)**—the mechanistic foundation of the Higher-Resolution Hypothesis.

I decided to formalize this hypothesis in writing to open it to collective scrutiny and dialogue. It is not presented as a conclusion, but as an evolving framework intended to be tested, refined, or challenged by others. My invitation to the scientific community is to engage with these ideas critically and creatively—to explore whether the proposed model can bridge subjective and biological perspectives, and to determine where further empirical or computational research might substantiate, revise, or refute its claims.

## Nature of This Work

This hypothesis originates from both lived experience as an autistic individual and rigorous engagement with neuroscience literature. It is offered as an **open theoretical framework**—not a formal publication or definitive conclusion, but an invitation for interdisciplinary critique, empirical testing, and collaborative refinement.

The framework is particularly intended to:
- Integrate disparate research findings into a coherent mechanistic model
- Generate testable predictions for experimental validation
- Inform more effective clinical and educational approaches
- Provide autistic individuals with a scientifically grounded understanding of their own cognition
