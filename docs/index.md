# The Higher-Resolution Hypothesis

The **Higher-Resolution Hypothesis (HRH)** proposes that autism arises from a distinct mode of neural organization—a **Distributed Pathway Model (DPM)**—where increased local branching and distributed propagation create higher representational density. This architecture yields richer, more detailed perception and cognition but also raises energetic demand, instability, and vulnerability to overload. The model unifies sensory, cognitive, and energetic phenomena under a single topological framework, explaining how executive strain escalates into predictive overload and ultimately metabolic collapse when competing activations exceed the brain's capacity to synchronize and sustain them.
