# Frequently Asked Questions

## Is this a formal publication?

No. It's an open theoretical framework intended to invite critique and collaboration. The canonical paper is provided for convenience and citation.

## How do I read at different technical depths?

Each topic page offers three tabs: **In-Depth Technical**, **Standard Technical**, and **General Explanation**. Use the tabs to switch levels; your selection is preserved as you navigate.

## What is the Distributed Pathway Model?

The DPM describes a neural architecture characterized by increased local branching and distributed propagation of activity, creating higher representational density. This topology produces richer, more detailed cognition but also increases energetic demand and vulnerability to overload.

## Is this framework testable?

Yes. The framework makes specific predictions about neural connectivity, metabolic patterns, and behavioral responses that can be tested through neuroimaging, electrophysiology, computational modeling, and behavioral experiments.

## How can I cite this work?

Please cite as:

> **Sindra, T. (2025).** *The Higher-Resolution Hypothesis: A Distributed Pathway Model of Autism.*  
> GitHub Repository. https://github.com/thiagosindra/higher-resolution-hypothesis

## Can I contribute or provide feedback?

Absolutely. This is an open framework designed to evolve through dialogue. You can:
- Open an issue on the GitHub repository
- Email feedback to [hrh@emailaccount.cc](mailto:hrh@emailaccount.cc)
- Propose empirical tests or refinements

## What about privacy and research ethics?

This framework integrates personal observation with scientific research. All concepts are presented in generalized, theoretical terms designed to be testable through standard research protocols.
