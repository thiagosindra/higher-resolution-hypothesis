%% Temporal persistence (tau) and delayed collateral recruitment
sequenceDiagram
  participant t0 as t0
  participant t1 as t1
  participant t2 as t2
  participant t3 as t3

  Note over t0,t3: A→B→C is active at t0. In DPM, activity decays more slowly (↑τ)

  t0->>t1: C remains active (slow decay)
  t1->>t2: Residual at B crosses collateral threshold → B→Y
  t2->>t3: Y→Z recruited (additional ensemble)

  Note over t0,t3: In NT, faster decay prevents delayed collateral recruitment.
