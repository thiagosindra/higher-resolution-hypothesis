## Affective Amplification

**Affective amplification** is the architectural tendency for otherwise neutral or mildly valenced inputs to acquire **stronger positive or negative feeling** when reactive overlap recruits limbic and interoceptive circuits. In the Distributed Pathway Model, increased branching creates more opportunities for sensory activity to collaterally activate emotion-processing regions (amygdala, vmPFC) and body-state networks (insula). When inhibition is delayed and persistence (τ) is elevated, these affective routes remain active longer, biasing subsequent appraisals. This can manifest as intense enjoyment and fascination (positive amplification) or disproportionate frustration and aversion (negative amplification), depending on which networks dominate and the individual's energy state.

## Cascade Susceptibility

**Cascade susceptibility** is the tendency for neural activation to snowball and spread in branch-rich networks, especially when inhibitory systems are weakened. In the Distributed Pathway Model, densely branched architecture creates more opportunities for activation to propagate across multiple pathways simultaneously. When inhibitory interneurons are compromised—particularly during energy depletion when they cannot maintain sustained firing—the temporal window for runaway cascades widens. This elevated susceptibility manifests as increased risk for subclinical seizure-like activity or, in vulnerable individuals, clinical seizure events.

## Distributed Pathway Model (DPM)

The core mechanistic framework proposing that autistic cognition emerges from neural circuits with 3-5× more neurons processing each representation, organized through branching pathways rather than streamlined routes. This architecture creates higher resolution processing but also imposes dual constraints: enhanced inhibition (to maintain signal clarity) and energy competition (from increased metabolic demand).

## Dual Constraints

The two fundamental limits imposed by distributed architecture:

1. **Enhanced Inhibition** — More active neurons recruit proportionally stronger suppression of competing circuits, creating exceptional focus but reduced flexibility
2. **Energy Competition** — More neurons consume more metabolic resources from shared local supplies, leading to context-dependent performance and progressive degradation under sustained load

These constraints interact critically: when energy depletes, inhibitory efficacy weakens, creating susceptibility to runaway cascades.

## Interoceptive Overbinding

**Interoceptive overbinding** is the collateral recruitment of **insular and autonomic** pathways by non-interoceptive inputs, increasing the **felt bodily intensity** of an experience. In distributed architecture with weakened inhibitory gating, sensory or cognitive processing can spill into circuits monitoring internal body states (heart rate, muscle tension, gut sensation, temperature). Once interoceptive loops engage, local energy demand rises and inhibitory efficacy falls, **prolonging** the state until metabolic buffers recover. This mechanism explains why some experiences feel "in the body" even when the triggering stimulus appears minor or external.

## Reactive Motor Cascade

**Reactive motor cascade** is the involuntary motor output that emerges when distributed activation exceeds inhibitory containment and spills into motor circuits. This is the mechanistic basis for stimming behaviors such as hand-flapping, rocking, pacing, or finger-tapping. Unlike volitional movement, reactive cascades arise when activation propagating through sensory, emotional, and cognitive circuits finds its path of least resistance through weakly gated connections to premotor and motor regions. The movements are characteristically rhythmic and repetitive because motor circuits naturally form oscillatory patterns when driven by sustained input, creating motor-sensory feedback loops that persist once initiated.

Suppressing reactive motor cascades recruits additional control networks (prefrontal cortex for top-down suppression, amygdala-mediated suppression under social threat), raising energetic load and potentially worsening dysregulation by retaining distributed activation while adding inhibitory costs.

## Reactive Overlap

**Reactive overlap** is the spillover activation from primary sensory or associative pathways into affective, interoceptive, or memory circuits due to **branching** and **delayed inhibition**. In the Distributed Pathway Model, collateral connections—both preserved through reduced synaptic pruning and continuously formed throughout life—create architectural opportunities for activation to spread beyond task-relevant regions. When inhibitory gating is weak or asynchronous, this overlap becomes more likely and persists longer, creating cross-domain effects such as affective amplification, interoceptive overbinding, and memory intrusions. Reactive overlap is not volitional—it emerges from the topology and timing properties of distributed networks.

## Subclinical Seizure-Like Activity

**Subclinical seizure-like activity** refers to transient, brief hypersynchronous neural events that may not meet clinical diagnostic thresholds for seizures but reflect the same underlying mechanism: excessive, synchronized firing across populations of neurons. In distributed architecture, these events emerge when branching pathways recruit larger populations while inhibitory systems (weakened by energy depletion or architectural vulnerability) fail to contain spread. These paroxysmal bursts may manifest as brief sensory distortions, cognitive disruptions, or motor twitches, or may occur entirely below the threshold of conscious awareness while still contributing to cognitive load and system instability.

## Valence Drift

**Valence drift** describes small initial valence shifts that **accumulate through re-entry and persistence**, biasing later appraisals until energy and inhibition restore balance. In distributed architecture with elevated persistence (τ), an input that initially carries mild positive or negative affect can trigger recurrent activation through feedback loops, progressively strengthening the valence signal. This creates "sticky" emotional states where the felt intensity grows disproportionate to the original stimulus. Valence drift is contingent on reactive overlap into limbic circuits and the energetic state of inhibitory systems—when energy depletes, inhibition weakens, allowing drift to continue unchecked.
