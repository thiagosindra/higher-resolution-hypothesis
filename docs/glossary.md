Key terms and concepts used throughout the Higher-Resolution Hypothesis framework.

## Cascade Susceptibility

**Cascade susceptibility** is the tendency for neural activation to snowball and spread in branch-rich networks, especially when inhibitory systems are weakened. In the Distributed Pathway Model, densely branched architecture creates more opportunities for activation to propagate across multiple pathways simultaneously. When inhibitory interneurons are compromised—particularly during energy depletion when they cannot maintain sustained firing—the temporal window for runaway cascades widens. This elevated susceptibility manifests as increased risk for subclinical seizure-like activity or, in vulnerable individuals, clinical seizure events.

## Distributed Pathway Model (DPM)

The core mechanistic framework proposing that autistic cognition emerges from neural circuits with 3-5× more neurons processing each representation, organized through branching pathways rather than streamlined routes. This architecture creates higher resolution processing but also imposes dual constraints: enhanced inhibition (to maintain signal clarity) and energy competition (from increased metabolic demand).

## Dual Constraints

The two fundamental limits imposed by distributed architecture:

1. **Enhanced Inhibition** — More active neurons recruit proportionally stronger suppression of competing circuits, creating exceptional focus but reduced flexibility
2. **Energy Competition** — More neurons consume more metabolic resources from shared local supplies, leading to context-dependent performance and progressive degradation under sustained load

These constraints interact critically: when energy depletes, inhibitory efficacy weakens, creating susceptibility to runaway cascades.

## Reactive Motor Cascade

**Reactive motor cascade** is the involuntary motor output that emerges when distributed activation exceeds inhibitory containment and spills into motor circuits. This is the mechanistic basis for stimming behaviors such as hand-flapping, rocking, pacing, or finger-tapping. Unlike volitional movement, reactive cascades arise when activation propagating through sensory, emotional, and cognitive circuits finds its path of least resistance through weakly gated connections to premotor and motor regions. The movements are characteristically rhythmic and repetitive because motor circuits naturally form oscillatory patterns when driven by sustained input, creating motor-sensory feedback loops that persist once initiated.

Suppressing reactive motor cascades recruits additional control networks (prefrontal cortex for top-down suppression, amygdala-mediated suppression under social threat), raising energetic load and potentially worsening dysregulation by retaining distributed activation while adding inhibitory costs.

## Subclinical Seizure-Like Activity

**Subclinical seizure-like activity** refers to transient, brief hypersynchronous neural events that may not meet clinical diagnostic thresholds for seizures but reflect the same underlying mechanism: excessive, synchronized firing across populations of neurons. In distributed architecture, these events emerge when branching pathways recruit larger populations while inhibitory systems (weakened by energy depletion or architectural vulnerability) fail to contain spread. These paroxysmal bursts may manifest as brief sensory distortions, cognitive disruptions, or motor twitches, or may occur entirely below the threshold of conscious awareness while still contributing to cognitive load and system instability.
